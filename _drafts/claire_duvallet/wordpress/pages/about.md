# About

I'm a PhD student in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. I work in [Eric Alm's lab](http://almlab.mit.edu), studying the relationship between the human microbiome and health and disease. More generally, I'm interested in applying **personalized medicine approaches for public health**. I'm passionate about making local impact to move our society toward a more just ideal. That means learning about and working for increased **diversity and equity in STEM** and **technical approaches for social good**. When I'm not in lab doing [research](https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/research/), I spend my time working to improve the BE Department student experience as one of the [BE Graduate Student Board](http://begradboard.mit.edu/) Diversity co-Chairs and as a member of the [BE REFS](http://berefs.com). As Diversity co-Chair, I'm especially proud of having co-started the [BE Application Assistance Program](http://be.mit.edu/academic-programs/prospective-graduate/beaap) and co-written the BE Department's [Community Values Statement](http://be.mit.edu/about/department-values-statement). Through REFS, I've learned **[conflict management](https://studentlife.mit.edu/conflictmanagement)** skills that have positively impacted almost every aspect of my life. When I'm not doing those things, I'm probably outside chasing after a **frisbee**. Through my involvement in the sport first in [Cambodia](http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/unconventional-sport-finds-unlikely-home-cambodia) and now on [MIT's women's team](http://scripts.mit.edu/~womens-ult/), I've become passionate about sport's ability to drive [social change](https://www.facebook.com/youthultimateproject) and push [gender equity](https://thenib.com/the-sports-wage-gap-needs-to-close) forward. Before moving to Boston, I lived for a year in **Cambodia** working for [Engineering World Health](http://www.ewh.org/) as a [Luce Scholar](http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx). Before that, I studied biomedical engineering at Columbia University.
