  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm a PhD student in the Department of Biological Engineering at MIT. I work in <a href="http://almlab.mit.edu">Eric Alm's lab</a>, studying the relationship between the human microbiome and health and disease. More generally, I'm interested in applying <strong>personalized medicine approaches for public health</strong>. I'm passionate about making local impact to move our society toward a more just ideal. That means learning about and working for increased <strong>diversity and equity in STEM</strong> and <strong>technical approaches for social good</strong>.

When I'm not in lab doing <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/research/">research</a>, I spend my time working to improve the BE Department student experience as one of the <a href="http://begradboard.mit.edu/">BE Graduate Student Board</a> Diversity co-Chairs and as a member of the <a href="http://berefs.com">BE REFS</a>. As Diversity co-Chair, I'm especially proud of having co-started the <a href="http://be.mit.edu/academic-programs/prospective-graduate/beaap">BE Application Assistance Program</a> and co-written the BE Department's <a href="http://be.mit.edu/about/department-values-statement">Community Values Statement</a>. Through REFS, I've learned <strong><a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/conflictmanagement">conflict management</a></strong> skills that have positively impacted almost every aspect of my life.

When I'm not doing those things, I'm probably outside chasing after a <strong>frisbee</strong>. Through my involvement in the sport first in <a href="http://www.phnompenhpost.com/post-weekend/unconventional-sport-finds-unlikely-home-cambodia">Cambodia</a> and now on <a href="http://scripts.mit.edu/~womens-ult/">MIT's women's team</a>, I've become passionate about sport's ability to drive <a href="https://www.facebook.com/youthultimateproject">social change</a> and push <a href="https://thenib.com/the-sports-wage-gap-needs-to-close">gender equity</a> forward.

Before moving to Boston, I lived for a year in <strong>Cambodia</strong> working for <a href="http://www.ewh.org/">Engineering World Health</a> as a <a href="http://www.hluce.org/lsprogram.aspx">Luce Scholar</a>. Before that, I studied biomedical engineering at Columbia University.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Two older graduate students in my department who I admire quite a bit have personal blogs, where they post life musings, computational insights, and other thoughts on grad school. They also happen to be two of the graduate students with whom I've had the most pleasure working, students whose work and approaches jive very closely with mine, and who seem to "get" that the non-science parts of science are super important too. They're probably going to graduate soon, so I figure I better start putting into practice some of the things I've learned from them.

Also, all the data science blogs say that "building your presence" is a good thing to do to get a good job. I'm not super pumped about making myself a "presence" - words can be taken out of context, my usual communication is mostly through body language, and I don't pretend to know anything at all, let alone know anything well enough to have it written down in a place where it's mine to own.

That said, I'm involved in some pretty interesting things that I wish the world knew more about (the things, not my involvement). And I often complain about feeling lonely - that I'm the only one this side of Kendall Square who cares about these things, who rejects the traditional academia/industry/other divide, who doesn't eat breathe and sleep science and who knows it. I know I'm not the only one, and I know that I should complain less especially since I know I'm not the only one. But I still wish there were more visible spaces for non-"academic" conversations in academia, and I wish that the accepted <em>de facto</em> in non-scientific spheres (i.e. society) were less accepted and challenged <em>de novo </em>more often by my peers. So here we go.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Ground Rules</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[When I was involved in CQA at Columbia, I learned that snaps are a great way to show agreement without being disruptive, and that Ground Rules are a wonderful thing to establish before having any sort of conversation.

Ground Rules are about respecting the space, its occupants, and the discussion taking place. They're meant to get everyone on the same page before getting into it the thick of it. So let's get on the same page. Some of these are for me, and some of these are for you.
<ul>
	<li>One of my favorite Ground Rules we used in CQA was to always assume the best of people. That meant that if someone had a language slip-up or said something triggering, we agreed to assume that it was an honest mistake and follow up accordingly. If I say something dumb, disrespectful, or silly here - assume the best of me and follow up accordingly.</li>
	<li>Arguing for the sake of arguing is not my hobby. Discussing for the sake of reaching mutual understanding is. I have no interest in engaging in aggressive conversations where one party is on the defensive. I have deep interest in genuine, curiosity-driven conversations.</li>
	<li>My words don't have to be perfect to be posted.</li>
</ul>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Here are some good articles that I've "written" about before by posting them to my Facebook.

<!--more-->

<h3><a href="https://medium.com/the-development-set/silicon-valley-s-unchecked-arrogance-d86cbb8db52#.dtiau52ba">Silicon Valley’s Unchecked Arrogance</a></h3>

Though I recognize that the products created in Silicon Valley and by pharma/biotech are quite different, I would argue that these arrogant attitudes are common to both communities. In the realm of healthcare - where many of our problems are literally matters of life or death - who is being left behind? And why are our brightest minds not more concerned with <em>those people</em>?

It's also why I get so angry when people tell me things like, "You're getting a bioengineering PhD and you don't want to do academia? Oh, well <em>of course</em> you're going into biotech, there are no other reasonable options."

<h3><a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/12/15/whites_against_trump_kamau_bell_tells_white_people_yes_even_you_good_liberals_to_come_get_your_boy/">Whites Against Trump: "White Liberals Come Get Your Boy"</a></h3>

Confession: the reason I'm not following or responding to election shenanigans is that I'm embarrassed for my people. I am ashamed to be a white American.

"And keep in mind, whiteness is still invisible. And white people have invested so much in making it that way. Maybe you’ve illuminated it for a hot second by shining a spotlight on Trump and connecting him to it – and as long as that’s a diversionary tactic, as long as he’s an aberration, everybody is gonna stay on the bus. But when you spin that spotlight toward the audience? 96th Street, my dude." [96th st reference: "Mass white exodus time, like when the 2 train hits 96th Street"]

<h3><a href="https://medium.com/@AnandWrites/the-thriving-world-the-wilting-world-and-you-209ffc24ab90#.79jr4prr0">The Thriving World, the Wilting World, and You</a></h3>

In November, I posted: 'As I stand on the verge of choosing what kind of research I want to dedicate the next five years (or maybe more) of my life to, I struggle to reconcile the parts of me that want to change the world with the parts of me that want to be absolutely sure that I will not leave things worse off than before.'

Now that I've found a happy lab home and am out of survival mode, the question's had space to change: how can I do more than simply 'not leave things worse off than before' - how can I contribute to creating solutions that address the root causes of inequality and injustice, rather than merely their symptoms? That actually improve the world, but disproportionately so for the disadvantaged? That make it harder for the privileged - people like me! like us! - to coast by on their hard-but-all-things-considered-not-<em>that</em>-hard-earned success?

And how does getting a PhD from MIT fit with all that? And how I could become confident about writing "we" instead of "I" in the previous paragraph? My dear grad school friends, I need your help with this last one. :)

<h3><a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/john-metta/i-racist_b_7770652.html">I, Racist</a></h3>

<h3><a href="http://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2013/04/relationships-are-more-important-than-ambition/275025/">Relationships are more important than ambition</a></h3>

"After all, relationships and community impose constraints on freedom, binding people to something larger than themselves."

I think this statement is true and beautiful and that our knee-jerk responses to it probably say a lot about what kinds of relationships we have and value. :)

<h3><a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120178/problem-international-development-and-plan-fix-it">Stop Trying to Save the World</a></h3>

As I stand on the verge of choosing what kind of research I want to dedicate the next five years (or maybe more) of my life to, I struggle to reconcile the parts of me that want to change the world with the parts of me that want to be absolutely sure that I will not leave things worse off than before.

If you've ever heard me talk about how before last year, all I wanted was to do was focus on tec<span class="text_exposed_show">hnologies for developing countries but now, after living in Cambodia for a year, I'm not so sure - this article explains a lot of it.</span>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[As part of the Microbiome Club's outreach activities, Tu and I are teaching a group of high school girls about the microbiome next week. We're developing a 3-day curriculum on bacteria and the human microbiome as part of the <a href="http://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/teen-programs-overview">Young Leaders in STEM</a> summer program led by the <a href="http://www.scienceclubforgirls.org/">Cambridge Science Club for Girls</a>.

A side, non-science note: this program is part of the <a href="https://www.cambridgema.gov/DHSP/programsforkidsandyouth/MSYEP">Cambridge Mayor's Program</a>, which places teens in non-profit or public sector jobs and pays them for six weeks in the summer. I think it's such a cool idea - I was totally blown away when I learned about it! What a great way to get kids work experience, expose them to doing meaningful work, and keep them busy and out of trouble over the summer. Brilliant!

Anyway, as part of the course I'll be leading a lesson on DNA, mutation, diversity, and selection - i.e. evolution. We had this idea to play a game where we simulate evolution, giving students a starting sequence, mutating it with the roll of a die, and then deciding which mutations do and don't survive.

I wanted to make sure it was going to work, so I did what any computational PhD student would do and I wrote a simulation! You can find the code on <a href="https://github.com/cduvallet/evolution_game">my github</a>, which also includes the rules to play it in real-life. I'm super excited about how the simulation turned out, and I can't wait to play it with the girls next week! :D

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last weekend, I went to New York to attend Bloomberg's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/company/d4gx/">Data for Good Exchange</a> (and also hang out with my friends, eat bagels, and have brunch - obviously). I came in with pretty low expectations and left with a lot of excitement for finding myself a way into this field.

When I started grad school, when people asked me what I wanted to do after my PhD the only answers I had were things I <em>didn't</em> want to do (academia, industry, policy, high-tech bioengineering start up). Then, I started figuring out the individual parts more clearly: I want to work in a field related to health, I want to use my technical skills (i.e. brainz and computerz), and I want my work to disproportionately impact underserved populations. Okay, that was cool to figure out but I still didn't really know what <em>actual</em> jobs were at the center of that Venn diagram.

[caption id="attachment_225" align="aligncenter" width="349"]<img class="  wp-image-225 aligncenter" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/career_venn_diagram.png?w=680" alt="career_venn_diagram" width="349" height="217" /> My current career path Venn diagram. Who knew there was actually something at the center of it?![/caption]

So when I found the Data for Good community, I got really excited! I had a vague idea that public health was a place where my technical skills could be useful and where I could maybe have the kind of impact that I wanted - but I didn't know whether my frame of thinking was already valued in that space or if I'd have to try really hard to convince the people with the jobs that I have the intersection of skills and interests that they want. So to find a community of people specifically interested in applying their computational skills to advancing the social good - so awesome!

<!--more-->

That said, I'm really <a href="https://medium.com/the-development-set/silicon-valley-s-unchecked-arrogance-d86cbb8db52#.dtiau52ba">wary</a> when I see the words "technologists" and "social good" in the same paragraph. It just brings me right back to the <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120178/problem-international-development-and-plan-fix-it">discomfort</a> I had with the NGO "scene" in Cambodia. I'd been following a few blogs and had a <a href="https://dssg.uchicago.edu/2016/08/18/the-real-world-dssg/">pretty good feeling</a> about it, but I still wanted to see for myself how much hype vs. content the actual people in the community have.

The Data for Good Exchange seemed like a great place to start figuring this out, so I went into it not really expecting much. At first, I walked into Bloomberg and was blown away by the swankiness of the place - beautiful, open spaces and free snacks as far as the eye could see. Okay, still skeptical. Then I walked into the main meeting room and saw tote bags and useless swag - uh oh. (How much "Social Good" could Bloomberg have done with the dollars they spent on the wood puzzles they gave us?). The first keynote had a hype-to-content ratio of like 8 to 3 - telling us that opaque machine learning algorithms that de-humanize people are bad, both ethically and  technically. Yeah, duh.

But then the conference really got rolling. The second keynote was a panel with the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy. Awesome. And then almost every single talk I saw for the rest of the day had both the data scientists who did the data work <em>and</em> their on-the-ground partner - non-profits, foundations, public/governmental organizations. And what's more, it's clear that the projects were truly <em>partnerships</em> - it wasn't like the partner gave their spiel and then the data scientist gave theirs and neither one knew about what the other was talking about, the presenters clearly knew each other well and were engaged in a continuing conversation. These projects were not disconnected from reality and then loosely tied back with a "Broader Impact" fluffy fluff statement (like is so common in academia) - they were really projects born of true partnerships. Which is so great - sign me up! :D

The coolest part of the conference was the "Future of Data Work at Aid Agencies" panel. The panelists were "chief something something" at World Bank, UNICEF, and USAID (plus someone from Facebook working on public policy something something). Dayum. The conversation was also really enlightening, and definitely made me consider a new way of looking at global aid work. Yes, I have issues with how neo-colonialist aid is currently approached, but those issues maybe apply less at the higher levels of these large aid organizations. For example, compiling GDP statistics or figuring out better ways to collect data to monitor impact - this kind of work doesn't have to be done by local people with local context, and is more, like, just a job. In other words, there's lots of different ways to get involved with aid work - and not all of it is riddled with the complexity of white savior complex etc.

Something else that struck me from the aid panel was the different timescales of data. I think a lot of people think that more and faster data is always better. But the guys at these aid organizations were like, meh - sometimes it's better but sometimes you really only need one survey every five years (for example, to measure the impact of an education initiative). That said, data-informed change can happen much faster than organizational structures often let it - and so the conflict between this fast-paced world that we live in now and the necessarily slow pace of systemic change is really fascinating. I loved the maturity with which the panel approached data work in aid - they recognized data's value and power but didn't see these large organizations as <em>limiting </em>data's impact. In fact, even though working within these massive organizations is slow and blundering, it's also incredibly powerful and has the potential to turn new best practices into worldwide adopted standards. If that's not impact, I don't know what is.

Related to this conflict between big, slow structures and fast, weasely data was the idea of private vs. public work and money. One of the speakers from the University of Chicago's <a href="https://crimelab.uchicago.edu/">Crime Lab</a> said that their goal was to "use private dollars to leverage the public dollars." In other words, they fund studies to gather data on the impact of existing small initiatives so that they can show the results to government officials and convince them to scale up the initiatives to the city- or state-level. Again, I really love this attitude of respecting the kind of systemic change government is able to make - if you just give it the chance and the power to tell its opponents, "No, I'm definitely sure this will lead to positive change." That said, the people we saw at the conference are already data-literate and data-sympathetic. How do we convince the others who aren't at this conference? I'd love to see conferences like this explicitly address the communication gap that I'm sure exists between scientists and public officials. Analyses are nothing if they're not paid attention to.

Essentially, my goal in going to this conference was to figure out if I should keep going to these conferences. From what I saw this weekend, I think the answer is a resounding yes. So excited to have found a community of people who are so motivated to do good with good science.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Impostor syndrome</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My thesis proposal is on Tuesday, which of course means that I've been thinking a lot about impostor syndrome. The way I process difficult emotions is by talking about them to my friends, and in this process it's crystallized to me that impostor syndrome comes in so many different flavors, some of which are much harder to address than others.

<!--more-->

<strong>"Everyone else is better than me."</strong> I think this one is most common and easiest to address, especially in grad school. It takes some willpower, but it's pretty achievable to convince yourself that everyone's path is so different, everyone brings different things to different projects, and their success is totally independent from yours. So comparing yourself to others is like comparing two quantities with different units - it just doesn't make sense.

<strong>"No one cares about what I'm doing; Who would ever care about what I'm doing?; My work is pointless; My work is worthless."</strong> Man, getting zero feedback can be so much worse than getting negative feedback. Our brains fill that vacuum with all of our worst fears. It's like when you have a pimple on your face and you walk into a room and think everyone is staring at your pimple, when actually they're just busy thinking about their own pimples. (There's a better explanation of this, and science to go along with the effects of <a href="http://drennan.mit.edu/education/education-interests/teacher-and-mentor-training/#Diversity-Training">stereotype threat</a>). I think for this one, it's important to remember the positive feedback you've gotten in the past. I was talking to my labmate about this yesterday, and his face was beaming as he was telling me about feedback he got from a "big shot" at a Gordon conference - he said he actually wrote a journal entry about it, so that he'd remember it. I think that's a great idea, and I wonder the best way to implement it in my own life. I also think this is where senior labmates can be a really positive force - talking with them about your ideas and your work, and getting that #validation you're not getting from your advisor. A handful of senior post-docs kind of adds up to one PI, so it can feel really good to get that feedback.

<strong>"I'm not good enough to be here. I don't belong here."</strong> Oof. This is the big one. I think people tend to address it with platitudes like "but you <em>are</em> here, they picked you for a reason, they wouldn't have accepted you if you didn't have what it takes" and I don't know a single person who's been comforted by those words. I think here, it's just about getting through it. Waking up tomorrow and going to work. Talking to your friends about feeling shitty until you don't feel shitty anymore. <em>shrug</em>

That's where I've been for the last week and a half. More specifically, "the one thing the thesis proposal is evaluating - my ability to be and think like a good scientist - is the one thing I don't think I'm any good at. Well, shit."

I feel a little better now, which happened in two waves. First, I was talking to my best friend, who is also a PhD student who struggles with impostor syndrome, and she realized that "nothing they could say would make us feel better about ourselves." It's true - nothing my committee will say, apart from straight-up "good work" - will make me feel less shitty. So it's got nothing to do with them and their approval, really. The second wave was last night, talking to a friend who, after I said I'd probably just feel shitty for a while and then be fine, challenged me to "not feel shitty for three weeks after the proposal - maybe one week". Zero impostor syndrome isn't the goal, because it's not achievable - but reducing its extent could be, and is also valuable as a goal. Okay, fine. Challenge accepted.

So nothing they say will make me feel better, but at least I can try to feel less shitty for less time. That's a pretty positive goal, and achievable too. So I'm redefining success: I want to feel good about what I made, knowing that I digested feedback well and that my final product is an improvement on what I originally could have done. I don't expect my proposal to go well or to feel good. Instead, I'm motivated by making it less-bad, better than I expected. I still don't think I belong here, or that I'm "good" at "being" a "scientist" (by the traditional definitions of "good", "being", and "scientist" - the measures that are judged at formal checkpoints like thesis proposals). But I think if I can demonstrate adaptation and improvement, then maybe I'll prove to <del>them</del> myself that I could, just maybe, one day actually be "good" "enough" to not be an impostor here.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I just read two articles from my <a href="http://www.datascienceweekly.org/">DataScienceWeekly</a> email (so good! You should subscribe!) which do a really good job of humanizing data, talking so respectfully about its potential downfalls while also recognizing its tremendous opportunities for impact.

<!--more-->

<h3><a href="http://idlewords.com/talks/deep_fried_data.htm">Deep Fried Data</a></h3>

Of course, I love the call-outs of bias and "dirty oil" in machine learning, but my favorite part of this speech was the deep respect for humanity's messiness:

<blockquote>What irks me about the love affair with algorithms is that they remove a lot of the potential for surprise and serendipity that you get by working with people.</blockquote>

<blockquote>What if somebody grabs all this data, and does something with it that’s not scholarly?

Well, that’s what you want! A sign of life!</blockquote>

<h3><a href="http://reboot.org/2016/10/12/longreads-moving-real-time-data-real-time-programs/">Moving from real-time data to real-time programs</a></h3>

This is a blog post from Reboot, a consulting-ish firm focused on working with governments, foundations, and non-profits. The Aid Work panel at the <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/data-for-good-exchange-bloomberg/">Data for Good </a>conference I went to a few weeks ago was moderated by Reboot.

I like this blog post's focus on "putting in the work" - collecting data isn't always the answer, and even when it is part of the answer it's not usually the hardest part. I'm also so happy when I see organizations approach <em>conversations</em> as inherently valuable - it was like when I discovered the <a href="http://www.whatisessential.org/">Public Conversations Project</a> during conflict training, and I realized that it was totally valid to think that conversations have inherent value and potential for deep impact.

<blockquote>“The development programs that are most precisely and easily measured are the least transformational, and those programs that are most transformational are the least measurable.”</blockquote>

<blockquote>So when we get excited about new technology and new data, we also have to get excited about the processes, the time, and the conversations we’re going to put into extracting value from the data.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[After the realization that I live in an echo chamber with opaque blue walls, I started following Breitbart news on Facebook. It's been tough and enlightening, to say the least.

I've started noticing some patterns in how Breitbart presents their news and how my sources present their news and how my scientist brain wants to have news presented. I've found that my usual liberal sources are actually shockingly similar to Breitbart in many ways, and I'm starting to learn about so many of the nuances involved in communicating fairly. I never took speech or debate in high school, so I'm still processing a lot of these ideas. Today's news about Tom Price struck me as a really clear example to show these contrasting experiences. That, plus all the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Breitbart/posts/10158130092380354?match=YnJlaXRiYXJ0LGZha2UgbmV3cw%3D%3D">headlines</a> like "FAKE NEWS: &lt;deliberate manipulation or mis-interpretation of real news&gt;".

<!--more-->

I found out about Trump's pick for Health Secretary this morning, from a Facebook post by <a href="http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2016/11/28/report-obamacare-critic-tom-price-to-be-trumps-selection-for-health-secretary/">Breitbart</a>. The article says this about Price's Empowering Patients First Act:

<blockquote>Indeed, as far back as 2013, Rep. Price proposed to repeal and replace Obamacare by introducing the “Empowering Patients First Act,” which would provide coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. “[T]o make sure no one is priced out of the health insurance market because of a pre-existing illness or injury, the Empowering Patients First Act provides for the creation of robust pooling plans that would ensure that any one person’s health status does not increase his or her costs or the costs of others in the same pool.”</blockquote>

Sounds pretty alright, right? That was my thought at 9 a.m. this morning. Though of course I didn't have much to go off of, except what I was given...

That said, given that the Breitbart article was "breaking" the news, it's (sort of) understandable that there aren't more details in the article. I hope they'll take a more in-depth look into the plan (though I am also skeptical - most of the articles I've read from Breitbart are approximately the same length as this one).

This evening, my friend posted this <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/11/28/13772342/trump-tom-price-obamacare">Vox</a> piece about the same topic. It's at least five times the length of the Breitbart article, and has an in-depth analysis of Price's plan vs. Obamacare vs. the other Republican plans. It's got lots of great facts and gives some good pros and cons for Price's plans vs. the others.

<blockquote>The plans under Price’s proposal would near certainly be cheaper because they wouldn’t have to cover so many benefits. A 55-year-old under Empowering Patients might find lower premiums for plans that cover fewer benefits. But it’s also true that the plans that do offer comprehensive benefits would likely prove financially out of reach for many.</blockquote>

It also offers the analysis in a way that really respects the thought and work Price has put into his legislation:

<blockquote>Price will arrive at HHS with a clear blueprint for what comes next. He is the author of the <a href="http://tomprice.house.gov/sites/tomprice.house.gov/files/HR%202300%20Empowering%20Patients%20First%20Act%202015.pdf">Empowering Patients First Act</a>, one of the most thorough and detailed <a href="http://www.vox.com/2016/11/17/13626438/obamacare-replacement-plans-comparison">proposals</a> to repeal and replace Obamacare.</blockquote>

I also really like this article because it doesn't seem very biased to me - in fact, it assumes that Obamacare is definitely on its way out (and doesn't trumpet an appeal to the liberal masses to come out and save it):

<blockquote>
<p id="4oL0T4">The question right now isn’t <em>whether</em> Republicans have plans to repeal Obamacare. It’s which parts of which plans they’ll pick — and how quickly they’ll coalesce around one option.</p>
<p id="N2FjsU">But in choosing Price, Trump is signaling that he is serious about dismantling Obamacare. He has found one of the law’s most ardent, knowledgeable, and prepared opponents, and put him in charge of the effort.</p>
</blockquote>

That said, once I've been presented with all of the facts, it pretty clear to me that this plan goes completely against my values. And to people with different values, it might sound great! The thing is, you just can't take that journey with the Breitbart article - you're automatically taken to the destination.

The Vox article is just so rich, and also so rare. Since following Breitbart, I've started noticing how shallow most news articles are. Forget fake news - the real problem is that so many of the articles we read (including from the liberal media) don't even give us the news at all! They just jump straight to their value judgments, without ever giving us a chance to make our own.

  <title>Words matter - what is "diversity" anyway?</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In my work as my department's Diversity co-Chair, I've had the opportunity to think really critically about the language I (a white, cis, female) use when I talk about diversity. I had the privilege to work with a talented communicator as my first co-Chair. Together, we crafted a survey and resulting report distributed to my department's grad students and faculty. Recently, I've been involved with an <a href="http://be.mit.edu/academic-programs/prospective-graduate/beaap">application assistance program</a> and in drafting a "Code of Conduct" for our department. All of these involve(d) publicly releasing documents to the entire department - so it's important that we get the words right!

<!--more-->

I'm happy with where we've landed on most phrases - our goal of "advancing a respectful and caring community" (taken from the excellent MIT <a href="http://iceoreport.mit.edu">ICEO Report</a>) and our target demographic "[students] who bring a diversity of thought and experience to our student body" are statements that are specific enough to be clear in our intent and vague enough to be broad in our impact. There have also been times when I found it freeing to state exactly what we meant, for example: "students from academic institutions which have not historically sent many students to MIT".

And yet my title is still "Diversity Chair" - actually, a few months ago I went on our Graduate Student Board website and found that I was in fact the "Diversity Representative". So uncomfortable, and wrong!! Language matters, especially for people who have power and are engaging in spaces and initiatives with the goal of shifting existing power structures. No matter how pure the intent, a straight "ally" entering an LGBTQ space who refuses to use preferred gender pronouns is not an ally and will singlehandly change that space back to oppression - simply by the words they choose to use (and not use).

I had a great conversation with a friend before break about how to best engage with gender diversity efforts. As a bioengineer, this is really relevant to my efforts as well: our field is quickly approaching 50/50 gender balance - but are we really approaching equality? No, of course not. White (and, to a lesser extent, East Asian) women disproportionately benefit from "Women in STEM" initiatives. My friend told me that she'd recently shifted her perspective from <strong>women</strong> to <strong>marginalized genders</strong>. I love this, because in that description is not only the "who" but also the "why" - which also, in a way, adds different "weight" to different identities. By focusing our efforts on marginalized genders, it's pretty clear that an initiative that's successfully recruiting white upper-class women is not succeeding if it's not also reaching trans women, non-binary folks, and women of color.

The word <a href="https://mediadiversified.org/2015/12/30/is-diversity-is-only-for-white-people/">diversity</a> is also an interesting and problematic one.

<blockquote>To whom is all this directed? Who should read more ‘diverse’ literature? For whom is literature written by minority writers ‘diverse’? For whom are minority writers ‘diverse’? Can I describe myself as ‘diverse’ – do I exist in that space called ‘diversity’?

Although the lack of interest in our work on the part of white publishers is a very real problem, when we respond to and celebrate ‘diversity’, we don’t deeply challenge a white system. We only appeal to it, try to fit ourselves into it, make ourselves attractive to it to, trying to sell our ‘diversity’.</blockquote>

My previous co-Chair likes to couple "diversity" with another word to give it context and meaning (e.g. "diversity and inclusion"). I like to try to use words that describe impact as often as I can - "marginalized", "underrepresented".

My goal in thinking about how I'm using these words is to move the conversations in my well-meaning communities from those which focus on <a href="https://diversityjc.wordpress.com/2016/01/29/recap-what-is-diversity/">"diversity" outcomes</a> without recognizing the deep systems of oppression that have led us to where we are:

<blockquote>The goal of inclusion and diversity should be to be amazed by the work someone does and not the person doing it. And of course, making clear to anyone feeling marginalized that 1. It can get better and 2. they too can pursue things they naturally gravitate towards doing, without threat of bias. Just being a part of humanity, being treated how they want to be treated, feeling included.</blockquote>

to ones which <a href="https://diversityjc.wordpress.com/2016/02/01/what-is-diversity-take-2/">recognize</a> all of the baggage that comes with this business. The nuance, depth, and commitment required to truly address "diversity", because truly engaging in this work means changing how everything in our society is valued and giving up our own undeserved power.

<blockquote>Institutions should not be saying “hey we need to hire more women because it’s the right thing to do” – they should be accepting that <em>business as usual</em> is discriminatory and narrow in its world view. <em>It is structurally a white man’s world</em>. Institutions need to be developing a deeper, richer, curriculum that accesses research done by a more <em>diverse</em> group of scientists, that engages beyond traditional historical narratives. They need to be prioritizing social justice training, having conversations about microaggressions, actively addressing sexual harassment. They need to engage their existing staff and students in the conversations about diversity, why it matters, and how to address it.
<code>
</code>Institutions need to do more than implement diversity programs. They need to recognize the importance of changing institutional culture, and do something about it.</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I just ran across this <a href="http://www.liftstream.com/women_biotech_boardrooms.html#report">report</a> about gender diversity in biotech boardrooms (spoiler: it's not great).
<blockquote>An optimistic output of the study is that almost 58% of the studied boards now have women serving on them.</blockquote>
There is nothing optimistic in that statistic - a little less than half of boards have<strong> no women at all</strong>. Progress won't be made so long as we keep framing reality in bullshit ways like this.
<blockquote>...diverse boards (having at least one seat held by a woman)...</blockquote>
I'm sorry, what? One (probably white) woman on the board is enough to be considered "diverse"?

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Yesterday, I attended the <a href="https://www.widscambridge.org/">Women in Data Science Conference</a> in Cambridge. I went in hoping to learn more about data science as a field, to identify career opportunities in data science for computational biologists interested in public impact, and to feel inspired by being in a room full of women doing science. I'd say the conference wasn't well-structured enough (i.e. tied together by a common theme) for the first goal and not varied enough in topics for the second one. That third goal, though - nailed it.

<!--more-->

I counted approximately five men in the audience - awesome! What a great gender ratio, for a change. All of the speakers were women, obviously (look conference organizers, it's not that hard!) Actually, the few times I've been in these kinds of spaces there's a flickering voice that's like "but equality is 50/50" and then I remember (1) that voice is society's, not mine and (2) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fkwXw8T_qso#t=67m31s">Ruth Bader Ginsburg's wisdom</a>: our fields have been dominated by men since forever, and all-male conferences are so common. All-woman conferences are not only justified, but also long overdue.

Some of the talks were better than others (Diane Greene seems like a true gem, <a href="http://www.widsconference.org/livestream.html">srsly (@8:58)</a>) but the panel was the shining moment of the event. I was struck by three main themes in these women's responses:

<strong>Survivor bias has selected for women who were "oblivious" to gender-related discrimination and microaggressions.</strong> You often see the trailblazing women in the sciences saying that they never experienced discrimination and that STEM fields are meritocratic so what's the big deal? I would say the women on yesterday's panel are one or one and half generations behind these original trailblazers, and it was interesting to hear them explicitly acknowledge that "maybe we're the wrong people to ask about this" because they'd never really paid attention to or noticed any gender discrimination. (One particularly outspoken speaker, Jennifer Chayes from Microsoft Research, said that she didn't recognize the implication of all the other women dropping out of her physics PhD program until many years later - talk about a failure in pattern recognition! :P) This leads to a lot of interesting questions, of course: did they not pay attention to it because they were always the best and so naturally overcame the impossibly high threshold for women to achieve respect in their male colleagues' eyes? Is their obliviousness the reason for their success? Should women follow their lead and just ignore the constant micro-aggressions and lack of representation and charge on? Do we really want to be selecting only for these types of women? (No.) Fascinatingly, all of the women on the panel said that they began to notice gender discrimination (and get really angry about it!) when it started affecting their junior colleagues.

<strong>Successful women find support in strong peer networks of strong women, which provide the mentorship they don't get from non-existent mentors.</strong> Another common theme was that many of these women were bad at asking for help and "just stumbled along" until they formed a strong network of peers, and that these networks provided the mentorship they didn't get from more traditional mentors and role models (probably because there were none). I find the same thing in my peer group - I have mentors for science and career things, of course, but when it comes specifically to dealing with being a woman in STEM, I look to my peers. In the past few years, I've slowly realized how often my female friends and I talk about being women in STEM, how empowering those conversations are, and how oblivious to them most of my male colleagues must be. Multiple friends of mine have told me stories of being taken aback by a male loved one's well-meaning, appalled question "does that really happen <em>today?</em>": yes, honey, this is what I experience on a daily basis.

<strong>Just do what a man with your qualifications and abilities would do. </strong>I really liked this advice that a few of the panelists gave. Challenge yourself to act in the way that a man with your abilities would act. Speak up in the meeting even if you're not 100% confident about your idea. Sell yourself because, yeah, you are badass. "Lord, give me the confidence of a mediocre white man." But actually.

That said, I always have issues with when the conversation falls into a "men do this" or "men are more ___ than women" - for example, in the family conversation or in the confidence discussion. I'm not sure how to move these conversations into a less hetero-normative space, allowing for multiple expressions of both man- and womanhood (and all the other hoods that don't fit in those boxes too). I guess I wish more speakers and commenters would recognize society's roles in these (relatively justified) stereotypes they're presenting: a little bit more of the "He for She" movement could actually go a long way to keeping these conversations from spiraling into an "us vs. them" crusade that only serves to further entrench the societal norms holding us all back.

Also, let's talk about race and other intersectional identities next time.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>A response to "The Pay Gap Myth and Other Lies That Won’t Die"</title>

  <description/>
  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I dated (and very much liked!) someone who made similar points as in <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/438775/pay-gap-studies-disprove-myth-sexism-responsible">this</a> National Review article. It wrenched my heart to hear his "arguments" then as it does to read them now. But this time, I'm not in an emotionally charged conversation, and I can respond:

<blockquote>We expect to hear a lot of lies during an election year, and this year is certainly no exception. What is surprising is how old some of these lies are, and how often they have been shown to be lies, years ago or even decades ago.

One of the oldest of these lies is that women are paid less than men for doing the same work. Like many other politically successful lies, it contains just enough of the truth to fool the gullible.</blockquote>

Okay, already you're insulting and alienating people who don't agree with you. I see this in every conservative news source I've started following (Breitbart and National Review, though I imagine Facebook's algorithm gives me some other ones sometimes). You can't argue against polarizing media and call everyone who doesn't agree with you liars in the same breath. (Thankfully, the person I dated came into the conversation with a much more open mind. It's amazing how important tone is for outcome.)

<blockquote>Women as a group do get paid less than men as a group. But not for doing the same work. Women average fewer annual hours of work than men. They work continuously for fewer years than men, since only women get pregnant, and most women are not prepared to instantly dump the baby on somebody else to raise.</blockquote>

Word. Women are the ones who get pregnant and there are logistical consequences. Can we talk about confounders? Societal structures that lead to women working for fewer years? How about that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unpaid_work">unpaid labor</a> women disproportionately do at home? If I know I have dinner waiting for me at home (because my wife came home early from <em>her </em>job to cook it), I'll probably work late.

<!--more-->

Can we talk about the implications of women working fewer years than men? About the (not-really-choices) choices that women make when they abandon or sidetrack their careers for their young children? Can we talk about ways that we could restructure our society to support women so that they wouldn't have to make that choice, or so that the choice would feel less like choosing the lesser of two evils? So that both the women who want to stay home with their kids and those who want to continue pursuing their careers can do so without judgement and without needing to have super-human powers? Can we talk about ways we could give space for and even encourage men to share in that beautiful work of creating a family?

<blockquote>Being a mother is not an incidental sideline, and being a single mother can be a major restriction on how much time can be put into a job, either in a year or over the years.</blockquote>

Agreed. See above on societal structures. Can we talk about whether it's <em>right and just</em> that being a single mother can restrict her opportunities?

<blockquote>People like Hillary Clinton can simply grab a statistic about male–female income differences and run with it, since her purpose is not truth but votes. The real question, however, is whether, or to what extent, those income differences are due to employers paying women and men different wages for doing the very same jobs, for the very same amount of time.</blockquote>

<ol>
    <li>Don't even talk about about Hillary Clinton's experience with sexism. Just don't. (Yes, I'm mad.)</li>
    <li>Great point - that's a really important question! And there are many others. See above (and below).</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>As far back as 1971, single women in their thirties who had worked continuously since high school earned slightly more than men of the same description. As far back as 1969, academic women who had never married earned more than academic men who had never married.</blockquote>

It's 2017. Things can change for the better and they can change for the worse. For example, programming <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2016/09/what-programmings-past-reveals-about-todays-gender-pay-gap/498797/">used to be</a> a female-dominated field. What a world! What an unexpected twist!! (Because men are biologically better at programming, right?)

Also, can we talk about your sample populations here? Academic men and women who had never married? How many people in National Review's readership fit that bill? In other words, can we talk about who we're talking about?

<blockquote>People who are looking for grievances are not going to be stopped by facts, especially if they are in politics. But where are our media pundits and our academic scholars? Mostly silent, either out of fear of being denounced as anti-women or because they have chosen to take sides rather than convey facts.</blockquote>

Can we talk about, like, all the people who aren't silent on this? Maybe even some women? I can call up probably any of my working female friends and they'll be happy to tell you their salary and their male colleagues' salaries. And honestly, I think you and I will both be surprised - I'll realize that I've been more pessimistic than reality calls for, and you'll realize that things are different now than they were then.

Can we talk about other reasons people might not be on your side?

<blockquote>It is much the same story with black–white comparisons. More than 40 years ago, my own research turned up statistics on black and white professors who had Ph.D.s from equally high-ranked institutions in the same fields, and who had published the same number of articles.

When all these things were held constant, the black professors earned somewhat more than white professors. But, since all these things are not the same among black and white professors in general, there is a racial gap in pay that allows some to loudly denounce racial discrimination among academics.</blockquote>

Can we just talk about this? Like just this.

<ol>
    <li>Once you hold all these things constant, you've automatically selected for some badass black professors, because if they're at the same level as a white professor then you can bet they've probably worked infinitely harder than that white professor. I would hope that they get paid as much? No, I would hope that they get paid <em>according to their value</em>, which is honestly probably way more than their white colleagues.</li>
    <li>Can we talk about why those things are not the same, why the racial pay gap persists? Also can we talk about how it seems like that's okay with you? How that doesn't seem to be convincing enough evidence of racial discrimination? How discrimination doesn't have to be explicit, and how calling out discrimination doesn't mean I'm calling <em>you</em><em> </em>a racist? (Though, tbh, we're all racist. But that's for another conversation. Baby steps.) How there are so many ways for discrimination to happen? The assumption that denouncing racial discrimination is a bad thing, and ways in which it might be a good thing?</li>
    <li>And I'm really impressed there were enough black professors then to do a robust statistical analysis - what's your sample size? What fields were these professors in? I too am interested in cutting through the rhetoric and getting to the facts. I'm also an engineer, and I love numbers! Can we talk about numbers?</li>
</ol>

<blockquote>Those who wish to check out my statistics can get a copy of my 1975 monograph, Affirmative Action Reconsidered. It has not been updated because not all the same statistics will be released now. This is not unusual. Statistics that might undermine some other popular conclusions — whether on affirmative action, global warming, or whatever — have been kept under wraps when other researchers tried to get them.</blockquote>

Can we talk about other ways to get this data and other reasons it may not be available? Can we talk about not giving up when something is hard, about rolling your sleeves up to support your argument <em>all the way</em> to its conclusion?

Also can we talk about the year that we are currently living in, and how different society is now than it was when this was written? Can we talk about how humans learn and change and respond to new information and how that's not only <em>totally okay</em>, it is <em>beautiful?</em>

<blockquote>Too many people in the media and in academia abandon their roles as conduits for facts and take on the role of filterers of facts to promote social and political agendas.</blockquote>

Can we pause for a moment of self-reflection?

<blockquote>There are many reasons why old lies, refuted long ago, are still heard every election year, and in all too many other years.</blockquote>

Can we stop calling my lived experiences a myth? It really hurts. It makes me feel invisible, undervalued, and unheard - and I know you can relate to that feeling.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I'm sure <a href="https://phylogenomics.blogspot.com/2016/10/the-white-mens-microbiome-congress.html">Jon Eisen</a> will have much more to say on this very shortly, but I just saw a <a href="https://microbiomedigest.com/2017/02/20/wageningen-microbiology-centennial-a-very-male-celebration/">post</a> on Elisabeth Bik's blog about Wageningen University's <a href="http://www.wur.nl/nl/activiteit/Microbiology-Centennial.htm">Microbiology Centennial</a>, which features ten keynote speakers who are all male. Womp womp.

A few reactions -

Not surprised. Damn it.

<!--more-->

And then when I scrolled down the page to see the keynote speakers for myself, very surprised at how physically worse it felt to see their faces of ten men than to have merely read Bik's description (even though her description also really hurts):

<blockquote>That is 11 men. No women.

I guess no women have contributed to the success of the Laboratory of Microbiology in the last decades. <em>Thanks ladies for all your hard work. Now move over, please, so that the guys can present your fantastic research!</em></blockquote>

Then even more surprised to see that the organizing committee has three women on it and only one man - but on further inspection it seems that the three women are admins or communications/marketing staff, and the man is a professor. I imagine he whipped up a list of the ten most influential people he could think of (AKA his friends AKA other successful people like him AKA other dudes like him AKA dudes) and haphazardly gave it to the admins to roll with it.

Okay, maybe I'm bad-mouthing that one dude. Looks like there's a Scientific Committee as well. Oh, nevermind - five out of five men on there too. Please, tell me more about your friends.

I've been on a symposium-organizing committee for the past year and a half, and the thing I'm proudest of is that we've committed to inviting speakers from diverse scientific and personal backgrounds. <a href="https://microbiome2016.wordpress.com/">Last year</a>, we accidentally invited almost all female speakers. <a href="https://microbiome2017.wordpress.com/">This year</a>, we're also on track to have a much more representative group than this centennial celebration. I've learned two things from my experience organizing our symposium:

<ol>
    <li>It really isn't that hard to host a symposium that's not all male. srsly.</li>
    <li>But you have to decide that it's something you want and be actively aware of it - otherwise, the status quo truly is white and male.</li>
</ol>

Last week, a graduate student leader emailed our department with student-nominated speakers for a seminar next Spring. All five nominees were male. I emailed the student to point this out, she said she was happy to add more names to the list, I asked my badass female engineer friends for some recommendations, and I sent her five additional names that she added. But the most frustrating part of that experience was that the organizer, a very successful graduate student in engineering and a woman herself, saw the list of five men and <em>sent it out anyway</em>. She mentioned feeling uncomfortable with tweaking the list in any way, for fear of conflict of interest - which I interpreted to mean as not wanting to be perceived of rigging it somehow. Isn't it amazing that we women in STEM are less comfortable with a perceived transgression on these "conflicts of interest" than we are with perpetuating our own lack of representation? That we're less comfortable with speaking up (which is only one step away from nagging which is only one step away from being seen as "difficult" or a bitch) than we are with supporting other badass women in science by nominating them and by inflating the list with their names when we see an all-male candidate pool? That even when we have power, we still use it as if we didn't.

At our last symposium meeting, I proposed to my co-organizers that we publicly post our <a href="https://microbiome2017.wordpress.com/symposium-policy/">symposium policy</a> on our commitment to diversity and how we choose speakers. I was really surprised to get some pushback - some of it was deserved (I was not very tactful and the meeting was running late) but some of it I think was based in this exact kind of discomfort. Life has not ever been and will never be a pure meritocracy. Men know this -- actually, they're probably oblivious, since they've never needed to confront it! Why do we women hold ourselves to a higher standard on "meritocracy" than the men in our fields?

I think any woman who's grappled with these thoughts knows the answer. What would have happened if that Scientific or Organizing Committee had a woman scientist on it? How much harder would she have had to work to convince these men that the women she wanted to invite were as worthy as their buds? How many brain gymnastics would she do to make sure that she wasn't being perceived as playing with Woman Card? What if she didn't have tenure, and they all did? How strong would she have to be to push back against an all-male conference?

<em>(Also important to note that all ten keynotes also seem to be white. I left out this aspect of the discussion mostly because I don't know enough about race outside of the United States' context to feel anywhere near comfortable commenting about it. Wageningen University is in the Netherlands, where 80% of the population is Dutch AKA probably white.)</em>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Men are sabotaging TV show ratings (and admissions committees?)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I came across this <a href="https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/men-are-sabotaging-the-online-reviews-of-tv-shows-aimed-at-women/">FiveThirtyEight article</a> looking at how men and women rate TV shows on IMDB. I love the creative analysis that the author did - it's pretty simple data (just ratings and associated gender of the rater) but the story that comes out is really interesting.

The author uses the "skewness" of ratings (i.e. what percent of ratings are made by men vs. women) as a proxy for how preferred the show is by one gender over the other. For example, a show with a large proportion of male raters is something like Star Trek whereas a show with a large proportion of female rates is something like Gilmore Girls. (Interestingly, I associate Star Trek with a pretty even gender split - I guess that says quite a bit about the kind of community I'm in! :P)

<!--more-->

This figure was particularly striking:

<img class="  wp-image-880 aligncenter" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/hickey-imdbmen-2.png" alt="hickey-imdbmen-2" width="582" height="642" />

The x-axis differentiates TV shows based on whether more men or women rated it; the y-axis shows the difference between how men rated the show versus how women rated it. The place where the red line crosses the x-axis illustrates that for a show to have the same average score from men and women, 85% of its raters were men. If we extrapolate the gender skewness of raters to how targeted a show is to a certain population, that means that for an average man to like a show as much as an average woman, it needs to be highly targeted for men.

This article is just about TV shows. What if it were about admissions or hiring decisions? Why wouldn't we expect a similar trend? People like what they like, and people who are used to being the majority voice in society probably trend towards others whose voices are similar - to shows, applicants, and potential faculty who are better targeted for them.

Another interesting parallel was a great line snuck in the intro:

<blockquote>When you rely on the wisdom of the crowd on the internet, you risk relying on the opinion of mostly men.</blockquote>

When we rely on the STEM "meritocracy," I think we risk relying on the opinions of mostly old-ish white men who don't realize that the shows [candidates] they consider "just as good" as their female counterparts are actually predominantly male.

It's also interesting to consider this from the female perspective: maybe women are more forgiving of male-targeted shows because we're used to it. We're used to adapting what we want to what's available to us, whereas men (or white people, or straight people, or whatever dominant group you want to talk about) have a plethora of options to suit their every desire. When you have a lot of choices, you have the luxury of being picky.

Ever since I discovered the show Miss Fisher's Murder Mysteries (which stars an unapologetically feminist lady detective in 1920's Australia), I just can't go back to watching mainstream TV. None of the women in my life are one-dimensional, so I don't see why I should be okay with them in my TV shows. When I make this statement to my friends, both male and female, I often get met with resistance or confusion. Men don't understand what I'm talking about until I point it out to them and we start listing shows with strong female protagonists together - a short conversation indeed - and women don't really know what they're missing. Or also don't understand what I'm talking about, because they don't realize that an alternative exists.

As for me, I've drank the kool-aid and I'm never going back. Whenever someone recommends a new TV show for me, I ask if there's a complex female lead. There usually isn't, and then the conversation ends there.

  <title>Reflecting mansplaining</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Active listening is a hallmark of conflict management. One of the most important parts of active listening is <a href="https://www.skillsyouneed.com/ips/reflecting.html">reflecting</a>, which means that you basically say what the other person just said. Sometimes you can also <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xSFHAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148&amp;dq=reframing+future+focused+communication&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=t28J00gwQ-&amp;sig=ejgrUrWiySJhESrKCP5N7e0Euf0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjwjvDQjtbSAhWm3YMKHbQvBgAQ6AEILzAE#v=onepage&amp;q=reframing%20future%20focused%20communication&amp;f=false">reframe</a> what they said to a positive, future-focused message (e.g. reframing a complaint into what they would <em>want </em>to be the case). Reframing is actually quite difficult to sustain, but reflecting is really easy - and transformative!

During my conflict management <a href="https://studentlife.mit.edu/conflictmanagement/trainings-and-workshops">training</a> in August, we were matched up with professional mediator mentors during our mediation role plays. My first mentor had a rule that we weren't allowed to ask any questions until we repeated what the speaker had just said. She would kick us in the shins if we jumped into questioning before reflecting. It was startingly effective - not just in reminding us to reflect, but also in making the mediation session move along productively!

Since discovering this way of communicating, it's all I ever want - both when I'm talking to others and also when I see people (mis)communicating.

<!--more-->

I've also started thinking that so many heated debates could be transformed into more productive, learning conversations if only there were more reflecting happening. For example, I saw this Facebook post about mansplaining yesterday:

https://www.facebook.com/kat.tanaka.okopnik/posts/10209142684503935

The thread on the first comment by a man named Alan is incredibly enriching and I highly recommend reading it all.

Apart from the great vocabulary and explanations provided by Kat and other commenters, I found it striking that Alan's comments were relatively non-inflammatory. Often in threads like this, the conversation quickly becomes accusatory and/or bigoted. In this case, it looks like Alan just doesn't "get" it.

How differently would his message have been received if it included some reflecting and reframing?

Rather than his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kat.tanaka.okopnik/posts/10209142684503935?comment_id=10209142703464409&amp;reply_comment_id=10209142717744766&amp;comment_tracking=%7B%22tn%22%3A%22R%22%7D">original response</a>:

<blockquote>So, there's some point in the future where it will no longer be OK for women to splain things to men in a belittling manner?
Or there will be some indeterminate future point at which enough women are doing this effectively enough to give it an insulting name?</blockquote>

What if he had written:

<blockquote>I hear your frustration with the systemic, societal structures that lead to men disproportionately talking down to or over women and getting away with it even when the women have more expertise.

I find that sometimes, I'll also be talked down to by women who think that I'm too thick/insensitive/unaware to grasp a concept. Even though I recognize that there aren't as many societal hierarchies at play in my experience, it still feels pretty bad.

While there's clearly a lot of work to be done with mansplaining and other types of 'splaining, I also think it would be amazing to live in a world where all people respected each other and didn't speak in belittling ways to each other - regardless of gender.</blockquote>

I think that comment would still be problematic and would still trigger an important conversation about mansplaining, but I wonder if the commenters on that thread would have been less defensive from the start.

Either way, I bet we would have felt better that he at least <em>tried </em>to listen and understand.]]></content:encoded>

Some comments:

Yes, Teen Vogue is really as awesome as the memes say. Highly recommend following them, if only to provide a nice counterbalance to those other <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/02/07/a-response-to-the-pay-gap-myth-and-other-lies-that-wont-die/">emotionally-draining</a> <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2016/11/29/the-problem-isnt-fake-news/">news sources</a>.

Noooooo why didn't I buy a pair of these before I knew about this noooooo! But also, at least now I'm spared the emotional conflict of deciding whether to continue wearing them or not. (To be fair, though, the Racked article makes it very clear that the workplace and team are still amazing and inspiring, it's just the leadership that poisoned it all).

My first response to the descriptions of CEO Miki Agrawal's "erratic behavior and refusal to shoulder blame for problems with the business while taking credit" was cringing (though tbh that last part is something I'm sure plenty of dudes do without getting any flak). Stories of a "middle school environment", of emotionally manipulative tactics and inconsistent policy or personality stances - these are only going to give fuel to the fire of people who say that women aren't emotionally stable enough to be in leadership positions, right? Damn it, now we're gonna have to denounce her and distance us other "good women" from that kind of behavior...

...oh, wait. This is how people of color feel when there's a high-profile crime committed by someone with their skin color. How Muslims feel anytime there's a terrorist attack carried out by someone with a name that even rhymes with Mohammad.

<blockquote>Similarly, everybody but white people has become well acquainted with the feeling of <em>oh fuck, please don’t let him be</em><u>             </u>while waiting to find out the identity of a criminal, an alleged criminal – hell, at this point, even a <em>victim</em>.</blockquote>

Alright, I guess we'll brace ourselves because this time looks like <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/12/15/whites_against_trump_kamau_bell_tells_white_people_yes_even_you_good_liberals_to_come_get_your_boy/">it's our turn</a>.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My friend posted <a href="http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3148&amp;context=dlj">this great essay</a> on her Facebook this morning, and I'd highly encourage everyone to read it. It's titled "Obscuring the importance of race: the implication of making comparisons between racism and sexism (or other -isms)".

As a white woman in STEM who has mostly white friends who are also mostly in STEM, the majority of my conversations about inequality, oppression, etc tend to be anchored in the experience of being a woman in STEM. And while experiencing overt sexism and microaggressions does help us begin to understand other kinds of oppressions, this article makes a really strong point that it can also give us a pass by providing the illusion that we "get it", even though racism and sexism are very very different.

<!--more-->

<blockquote>For if we can convince ourselves that another's experience is "just like" ours, we are then exempt from having fully to comprehend that experience.</blockquote>

Empathy is crucial in this work, which is why finding analogies can be so helpful and motivating. However, at the root of allyship is a commitment to listening to other people's stories, wholly and selflessly.

This is another reason why conflict management training felt so impactful: at its core, everything we humans do that is beautiful and inspiring comes down to listening to and seeing each other as whole people.

<blockquote>We share a primal, and not unreasonable, fear that if we open ourselves enough to comprehend another's pain, we will lose our right to feel our own, especially if ours cannot compete in the pain sweepstakes.</blockquote>

One of the most powerful concepts I took away from training was the power of "and". You can love someone, <em>and </em>be really hurt by what they did. You can be a good person, <em>and </em>have made a hurtful mistake. You can be a compassionate person, <em>and </em>be really angry about a situation.

You can feel your pain, <em>and </em>recognize the depth of someone else's.

This article also provided clarity on something I've been thinking about in the back of my mind for a while: becoming aware of the ways in which society is messed up really sucks. Recognizing my privilege and my role in these complex systems is such a downer, like all of the time. But that's the whole point:

<blockquote>Talking about racism/white supremacy is painful for whites as well, but in a different way. Whites must confront their role as oppressors, or at least as beneficiaries of the racial oppression of others, in a race-based hierarchy. The pain of oppression must be communicated to the dominant group if there is to be any understanding of racism/white supremacy.</blockquote>

The pain of being oppressed can not be ignored or forgotten. When I recognize my own privilege and feel the pain that comes with that recognition, it's not like I'm deviating from a normal status quo to something abnormal. Quite the opposite: I'm deviating from something abnormal, a life cushioned by my whiteness, to something normal, a life in which race matters in every single thing that I do and experience.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>"Bad luck" cancer</title>
  <link>https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/03/31/bad-luck-cancer/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Two years ago, a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6217/78">paper</a> published in Science caused a big ruckus in the field when it argued that "the majority [of cancer risk] is due to “bad luck,” that is, random mutations arising during DNA replication in normal, noncancerous stem cells." (Unfortunately <em>Science</em> is closed-access, if you'd like me to send you the pdf please let me know. That's a story for another day though.)

There was a lot of pushback on the implications of their findings (which is also a story for another day - why do we get all huffed up when researchers make ethically-charged statements about diseases like cancer but not necessarily ones like HIV, TB, malaria, or infectious diarrhea?) and they just published a <a href="http://science.sciencemag.org/content/355/6331/1330.full">follow-up</a> to their original study. If you can let your eyes glaze over the one or two paragraphs that are a bit technical, I think it's actually a fairly easy and interesting read. I'm not going to comment on the science in this paper, but rather on the three things that struck me as I read it:

<ol>
    <li>Zooming out of US- or Euro-centric studies multiplies the possibilities we have for meaningful insights.</li>
    <li>Public data is powerful.</li>
    <li>Responding to public criticism with balanced, thorough science is awesome!</li>
</ol>

<!--more-->

<blockquote>"This hypothesis has generated much scientific and public debate and confusion, in part because our analysis was confined to explaining the relative risk of cancer among tissues rather than the contribution of each of the three potential sources of mutations ([environmental, hereditary, and replication error]) to any single cancer type or cancer case."</blockquote>

I really appreciate how the authors directly confront the public debate that happened around their previous paper. I also heartily commend the authors for their neutral tone throughout this paper - they're not defensively justifying their previous analyses, nor are they aggressively telling detractors that they're wrong. They're simply clarifying their position, and responding to criticisms by putting in the legwork to figure out how to address them. In this case, they had to back up their problematic claims with a more thorough analysis. It was probably pretty hard to do, and I'm really glad they did it. More scientists should work this way, responding to feedback with "yeah but that's hard" <em>and also</em> "okay we'll give it a try." Too often, we're satisfied with only that first part of the answer.

<blockquote>"In this study, we have evaluated cancer incidence in 69 countries, representing a variety of environments distributed throughout the world and representing 4.8 billion people (two-thirds of the world’s population). Cancer incidences were determined from analysis of 423 cancer registries that were made available by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) (http://ci5.iarc.fr/CI5-X/Pages/download.aspx)."</blockquote>

Public data is powerful. Public data repositories and consolidated efforts to systematically collect data are so important as a public good.

Looking at data from populations around the world is also important - and something we tend to forget to do. The <a href="http://hmpdacc.org">Human Microbiome Project</a> is actually 300 individuals from the US, recruited from basically only 2-4 cities. And yet in my field, it's one of the standard datasets we use as a gold standard comparison for what a "normal" human microbiome looks like.

<blockquote>"Second, these results explicitly and quantitatively address the difference between cancer etiology and cancer preventability. As illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3, these concepts are not equivalent. A cancer in which 50% of the mutations are due to R can still be preventable. The reason for this is that it generally requires more than one mutation to develop the disease."</blockquote>

We often talk about correlation and causation, and this paper forced my mind to wrap around a third: preventability. It's not the same, and it's one of the reasons basic science (for the sake of basic science) doesn't excite me - just because you figure out how a certain disease works, doesn't mean you'll know what to do about it!

<blockquote>"Our studies complement, rather than oppose, those of classic epidemiology."</blockquote>

Again with the really clear, neutral, forward-looking tone here. Love it. Also really appreciate that they provide ways that this study is complementary: cancers which don't seem to be driven by random errors are probably the best target for further investigation as to what environmental or hereditary factors may be contributing.

<blockquote>"Recognition of a third contributor to cancer—R mutations—does not diminish the importance of primary prevention but emphasizes that not all cancers can be prevented by avoiding environmental risk factors (Figs. 2 and 3). Fortunately, primary prevention is not the only type of prevention that exists or can be improved in the future. Secondary prevention, i.e., early detection and intervention, can also be lifesaving."</blockquote>

In other words, we're not saying that if you have cancer you just had bad luck and everyone should just give up on any cancer prevention efforts (pass me the cigarettes!). We're saying that some cancers are more about reducing environmental exposures whereas others are mostly about being unlucky, and so we should be approaching those two cases very differently! For the former, typical public health measures to reduce exposure; for the latter, more thorough screening even in people without traditional risk factors.

I only briefly skimmed the methods and don't know much about cancer biology, so can't speak to the actual validity of the paper too well, but I am certainly interested in what the follow up conversation in the field will be. Especially because the authors have set up an environment in which a productive discussion can flourish through the neutral presentation of their findings.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past year or so, I've become a full-fledged tidy data convert. I use pandas and seaborn for almost everything that I do, and any time I figure out a new cool groupby trick I feel like I've PhD-leveled up.

That's why it's so frustrating that I still can't find a good way to plot categorical scatterplots.

I want:

<ul>
<li>an easy way to plot a scatterplot where the points are colored according to an associated categorical variable.</li>
<li>to be able to manipulate this plot on the Axes object level (so that I can place it wherever I want, and so I can modify parameters after making the plot)</li>
<li>to be flexible with respect to my categorical variables (i.e. I don't want to hard-code any of them in, so that the plot is automatically updated if the number/identities of my categories change)</li>
<li>the code to be elegant and in the spirit of tidy data!</li>
</ul>

<!--more-->

<h1>Seaborn</h1>

As a tidy data convert, my first go-to is almost always seaborn. <a href="http://seaborn.pydata.org/">Seaborn</a> is great and I highly encourage everyone plotting in Python to get used to it. Functions for different types of plots all take basically the same inputs, so it's trivial to change your barplot into a boxplot and so on. It's also really easy to slice and dice your data in different ways: you just tell seaborn which column is the x axis, y axis, color, etc. It's also really nice because you can usually make a nice-looking plot with one line of code!

That said, every time I want to plot a scatterplot with points colored according to a categorical variable, I furiously google and <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26139423/plot-different-color-for-different-categorical-levels-using-matplotlib">StackOverflow</a> and end up with the following options that might be able to do what I want.

[code lang=python]
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline
sns.set_style(&#039;white&#039;)
df = sns.load_dataset(&#039;iris&#039;)
df.head()
[/code]

<div>
<table class="dataframe" border="1">
<thead>
<tr style="text-align:right;">
<th></th>
<th>sepal_length</th>
<th>sepal_width</th>
<th>petal_length</th>
<th>petal_width</th>

</tr>
<tr>

<td>5.0</td>
<td>3.6</td>
<td>1.4</td>
<td>0.2</td>
<td>setosa</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</div>

<h2>lmplot</h2>

<code>lmplot</code> seems like the obvious first choice, since it makes the plot I want. <code>lmplot</code> is a wrapper around <code>regplot</code>, which makes a scatter plot of x vs y-variables, and fits a regression to the relationship. When you turn off the regression, it's just a scatterplot. <code>lmlplot</code> wraps this functionality into a <code>FacetGrid</code> so that you can split your data according to a <code>hue</code> variable (and do the regression on each category separately).

However, it makes and returns a new <code>FacetGrid</code> instance, and it's unclear to me how to interact with the underlying <code>Axes</code> object. Also, there isn't any way to pass an existing <code>Axes</code> instance to the function, and so I can't put this plot on an existing figure (e.g. that I made using <code>plt.subplots()</code> or with GridSpec). I'm forced to have this be its own new stand-alone figure.

[code lang=python]
sns.lmplot(data=df, x=&#039;sepal_length&#039;, y=&#039;sepal_width&#039;,
hue=&#039;species&#039;, fit_reg=False)
[/code]

<img class="  wp-image-1185 aligncenter" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/scatterplotting-in-matplotlib_4_1.png" alt="Scatterplotting in matplotlib_4_1" width="416" height="345" />

[code lang=python]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.lmplot(data=df, x=&#039;sepal_length&#039;, y=&#039;sepal_width&#039;, hue=&#039;species&#039;, fit_reg=False, ax=ax)
[/code]

[code lang=text]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
TypeError Traceback (most recent call last)
in ()
1 fig, ax = plt.subplots()
----&gt; 2 sns.lmplot(data=df, x=&#039;sepal_length&#039;, y=&#039;sepal_width&#039;, hue=&#039;species&#039;, fit_reg=False, ax=ax)

TypeError: lmplot() got an unexpected keyword argument &#039;ax&#039;
[/code]

<h2>pointplot</h2>

This is another option I always forget about until I'm well into the rabbit hole (surprisingly, it doesn't come up often in my google searches). That said, maybe the reason it doesn't come up is that it actually doesn't do what I want. I'm not sure how to use this function to plot the individual points. This plotting function aggregates the points in each category with an estimator, and the <a href="http://seaborn.pydata.org/generated/seaborn.pointplot.html">documentation</a> even makes this explicit:

<blockquote>
  It is important to keep in mind that a point plot shows only the mean (or other estimator) value
</blockquote>

There go all my hopes and dreams...

[code lang=python]
ax = sns.pointplot(data=df, x=&#039;sepal_length&#039;, y=&#039;sepal_width&#039;,
hue=&#039;species&#039;)
ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45)
fig.tight_layout()
[/code]

<img class="aligncenter  wp-image-1187" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/scatterplotting-in-matplotlib_7_0.png" alt="Scatterplotting in matplotlib_7_0" width="438" height="317" />

Another really important caveat with this function is that it treats the x-axis as <em>categorical</em> values - I've been tripped up by this before! This can really mess up your interpretation of the graph, if you're expecting to look for a relationship between continuous x and y-values. This is <em>definitely</em> not the right kind of plot for this.

In the following plot, for example, look at how the x-axis jumps from 0.6 to 1.0. Ruh roh!

[code lang=python]
ax = sns.pointplot(data=df, x=&#039;petal_width&#039;, y=&#039;sepal_width&#039;,
hue=&#039;species&#039;)
ax.set_xticklabels(ax.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45)
fig.tight_layout()
[/code]

<h2>FacetGrid</h2>

Finally, we can go old-school <code>FacetGrid</code> + <code>plt.scatter</code> (I don't know why this registers are "old-school" in my mind but it does). Again, however, this returns a FacetGrid that you can't easily manipulate or move around. Womp womp.

[code lang=python]
g = sns.FacetGrid(data=df, hue=&#039;species&#039;)
g.map(plt.scatter, &#039;sepal_length&#039;, &#039;sepal_width&#039;)
[/code]

Because seaborn is a statistical plotting package, it tends to focus on making doing fancy things easier (while often times making doing easy things fancier...) This is one of those instances where it's not totally clear to me how to just plot the raw data.

<h1>ggplot</h1>

Okay fine maybe seaborn is too fancy to actually do this simple thing. Obviously what I want is to recapitulate R's ggplot functionality so why not use Python's own ggplot?

Answer: honestly, because it's a bit too early in its development and I find the lack of documentation frustrating. For example, I can't seem to find whether you pass in an Axis instance to the ggplot call somewhere to specify where to make the plot.

[code lang=python]
import ggplot as gg
gg.ggplot(df, gg.aes(x=&#039;sepal_length&#039;, y=&#039;sepal_width&#039;,

I also found that ggplot does a terrible job of dealing with nan's in the categorical value, considering them each an individual category. I imagine this has to do with the behavior of <code>set</code>, which also does not collapse nan's together.

dfnan.tail(10)

I could probably dig into this more, but honestly I don't really want to go down this rabbit hole. I'm just not hardcore enough to debug something that I know is still very early in development, and there isn't enough documentation or StackOverflow posts about it to be worth the investment.

<h1>pandas</h1>

I could probably use pandas, but as this <a href="https://dansaber.wordpress.com/2016/10/02/a-dramatic-tour-through-pythons-data-visualization-landscape-including-ggplot-and-altair/">fun article</a> points out, I haven't really found any cases where plotting with pandas is particularly more elegant than just going straight to matplotlib.

<h1>matplotlib</h1>

The first option with matplotlib is to manually define a dictionary mapping each categorical value to a color, as in this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26139423/plot-different-color-for-different-categorical-levels-using-matplotlib">StackOverflow response</a>.

[code lang=python]
df = sns.load_dataset(&#039;iris&#039;)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
colors = {&#039;setosa&#039;: &#039;red&#039;, &#039;versicolor&#039;: &#039;blue&#039;, &#039;virginica&#039;: &#039;green&#039;}
ax.scatter(df[&#039;sepal_length&#039;], df[&#039;sepal_width&#039;], c=df[&#039;species&#039;].apply(lambda x: colors[x]))

[/code]

<img class="  wp-image-1192 aligncenter" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/scatterplotting-in-matplotlib_20_1.png" alt="Scatterplotting in matplotlib_20_1" width="381" height="262" />

However, this has a few downsides:

<ul>
<li>you have to manually set the color for each variable</li>
<li>it breaks if there are values in your column which are not in the color mapping dict</li>
<li>and it doesn't seem to work with nan's</li>
<li>it's pretty ugly</li>
</ul>

[code lang=python]
colors = {i: j for i, j in zip(df[&#039;species&#039;].unique(), sns.color_palette(&#039;Set1&#039;, len(df[&#039;species&#039;].unique())))}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(df[&#039;sepal_length&#039;], df[&#039;sepal_width&#039;], c=df[&#039;species&#039;].apply(lambda x: colors[x]))

[/code]

<img class="  wp-image-1193 aligncenter" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/scatterplotting-in-matplotlib_22_1.png" alt="Scatterplotting in matplotlib_22_1" width="366" height="252" />

You could programmatically define the dictionary, but you'll have to handle <code>nan</code>s manually. Using <code>nan</code> as a dictionary key returns a <code>KeyError</code> because <code>nan</code> isn't equal to itself (more <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6441857/nans-as-key-in-dictionaries">here</a>). I think this is also the same reason ggplot throws an error when there are <code>nan</code>s in the categorical variable.

[code lang=python]
colors = {i: j for i, j in zip(dfnan[&#039;species&#039;].unique(), sns.color_palette(&#039;Set1&#039;, len(dfnan[&#039;species&#039;].unique())))}
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.scatter(dfnan[&#039;sepal_length&#039;], dfnan[&#039;sepal_width&#039;], c=dfnan[&#039;species&#039;].apply(lambda x: colors[x]))
[/code]

[code lang=text]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

KeyError Traceback (most recent call last)

...

in (x)
1 colors = {i: j for i, j in zip(dfnan[&#039;species&#039;].unique(), sns.color_palette(&#039;Set1&#039;, len(dfnan[&#039;species&#039;].unique())))}
2 fig, ax = plt.subplots()
----&gt; 3 ax.scatter(dfnan[&#039;sepal_length&#039;], dfnan[&#039;sepal_width&#039;], c=dfnan[&#039;species&#039;].apply(lambda x: colors[x]))

KeyError: nan
[/code]

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

In my case, I ended up going with the ugly, manual, versatile matplotlib way to make my plot: replacing <code>nan</code>'s with strings, manually defining my dictionary, adding a column with the colors, and using groupby to plot - but only because I knew exactly what values I was expecting.

[code lang=python]
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
colors = {&#039;setosa&#039;: &#039;red&#039;, &#039;versicolor&#039;: &#039;blue&#039;, &#039;virginica&#039;: &#039;green&#039;, &#039;nan&#039;: &#039;black&#039;}
dfnan = dfnan.replace(np.nan, &#039;nan&#039;)
for c, subdf in dfnan.groupby(&#039;species&#039;):
ax.scatter(subdf[&#039;sepal_length&#039;], subdf[&#039;sepal_width&#039;], c=colors[c], label=c)

[/code]

<img class="  wp-image-1195 aligncenter" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/scatterplotting-in-matplotlib_27_0.png" alt="Scatterplotting in matplotlib_27_0" width="385" height="271" />

I feel like the scatterplot is one of the breads and butters of data visualization - and though I recognize why seaborn approaches it the way it does, I'm still so surprised that there's no easy and versatile way to make a scatterplot colored by a categorical variable!

What do you use to make this common plot? Am I missing something obvious??!

<em>P.S. I still haven't figured out how to post code in a Wordpress post, so I'm just using the built-in Jupyter conversion from iPython notebook to Markdown. It's got some bugs in the formatting so I hope you forgive me for those, but this post has lived in my drafts too long to stay there! One day soon I'll be migrating my posts to a static, plain-text site which is much better at integrating code, but that day is not today...</em>]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I came across this great <a href="http://simplystatistics.org/2016/08/24/replication-crisis/">blog post</a> again today while doing some literature search for one of my projects. I remember really enjoying this post when I first encountered it, and it was as much of a joy to read the second time around!

What I appreciate about this article is that it doesn't try to refute the contentious <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124">claim</a> that "most [biomedical] research findings are false" but instead puts a <em>"yes and...</em><em>"</em> spin on it.

Many biomedical research findings are "false", <em>and also</em> that's to be expected. We're in a field without much basic theory to back us up, dealing with noisy and complex systems (oh hi humans) and noisy and complex measurements.

<blockquote>The replication crisis in science is largely attributable to a mismatch in our expectations of how often findings should replicate and how difficult it is to actually discover true findings in certain fields... Ultimately, when someone asks, “Why <em>haven’t</em> we cured cancer yet?” the answer is “Because it’s hard”.</blockquote>

<!--more-->

I also like this article because it reminds me of my own <a href="https://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n2/pdf/nrd1012.pdf">rants</a> about bioengineering research - I personally struggle to find inspiration and meaning in results based on cell lines or animal models (give me the real thing, like poop!) <em>and also</em> I recognize the tremendous <a href="https://progressreport.cancer.gov/trends">value</a> that these kinds of studies provide.

I would, however, add one bullet point to the end of the blog post's list:

<ul>
    <li>We should invest in science dedicated to understanding and developing the basic theory underpinning biological sciences.</li>
</ul>

I mean, we humans figured out thermodynamics -- you can't tell me biology is harder than that and we're just gonna give up!!]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Professor superlatives</title>
  <link>https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/04/18/professor-superlatives/</link>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Our department is hosting an event called "Profscars" (like the Oscars, but for profs). The social chairs organizing this event emailed our entire student body asking for nominations for superlatives for each professor.

A friend of mine pointed out that basically all of the women got superlatives based on their clothes/looks or mom status. I took a closer look and felt similarly appalled/taken aback, and then I did what any aspiring data scientist would do and decided to do some stats.

I counted the number of professors who had at least one superlative related to their physical appearance or that was related to parenting/familial status (e.g. most mom-like, most likely to talk about her kids, most grandfather-like), and separated it by men and women.

<!--more-->

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Comment on appearance or family</th>
  <th>M</th>
  <th>W</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Comment</td>
  <td>14</td>
  <td>9</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>No comment</td>
  <td>21</td>
  <td>5</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The fisher's exact pvalue for this distribution of comments is 0.2, so it looks like there isn't technically a significant difference in the distribution of comments between men and women.

That said, it's interesting that the majority of the male appearance-related comments were relatively creative and at times included an aspect of the person's personality, even in the looks-based superlative: "best shoulder definition", "least likely to wear socks with boots", "silverfoxiest", "best knowledge to height ratio". The women's categories, on the other hand, were more generic - "most fabulous outfits", "most adorable", "most likely to have adorable earrings", "best arms" (with a few more creative ones like "best pattern rocker", but for the most part relatively uninspiring).

To be honest, I'm a little disappointed that the stats didn't help me make our case - but I think this is probably partially driven by sample size. Out of 49 people listed, only 14 (28%) are women. And I'm sure if we dug down into lecture vs. professor status, and core-professor vs. joint-appointment we'd find some other interesting break downs by gender. My department is definitely thinking about this issue and working to improve it, but we're all fighting against a long history of inequality, especially in academia.

I think what I'm taking away from this is that:

<ol>
<li>We need more women faculty in my department</li>
<li>It's really easy to come up with appearance-based superlatives.</li>
</ol>

What'll be more interesting is to see who wins which categories, and how the winning superlatives differ between the men and women faculty.

<h3>Update</h3>

My friend is amazing and brought up a really good point:

<blockquote>
  the average number of comments per person is about the same regardless of gender (about 2.2 - 2.6, depending on whether you include people who didn't receive any comments), but the types of comments per gender is drastically different.
</blockquote>

If you count the <em>total</em> number of comments each person received, and categorize these comments by whether they included a mention of appearance or family, then it's a much different story.

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
  <th>Comment on appearance or family</th>
  <th>M</th>
  <th>W</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
  <td>Mentioned</td>
  <td>17</td>
  <td>16</td>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>Not mentioned</td>
  <td>75</td>
  <td>18</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

The p-value for this distribution of comments is 0.003.

Something else that my friend also brought up is that we ignored personality-type comments in these classifications - but many of these superlatives tended to be about what would traditionally be thought of as more feminine characteristics. Interestingly in our case, it also looks like a lot of the male faculty got these sorts of comments too. Guess we have a department full of grandpas...

This also made me think about the appearance comments: many of the men's appearance-based superlatives were things like "best beard," "tallest," "best shoulders" - typically male traits (obviously, these are guys) which are associated with strength and stature. But is it fair to say that the men's appearance-based superlatives were less problematic than the women's ones? The "problematicness" of these categories is entirely confounded with the people's genders: because these are silly student-nominated categories, we are enriching for looks-based superlatives. Men and women have different physical features and/or society has told us to notice different ones, <em>and also</em> society has told us how we value these features (i.e. male ones are associated with strength and dominance, female ones are associated with fragility and definitely not STEM). So I think it's all confounded, but at the same time - the "problematicness" of the women's superlatives is real - regardless of where it comes from.

I think it's just on us collectively to ensure that we put in critical thought for these sorts of spontaneous, student-nominated efforts. Much like my previous <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/microbial-centennial-of-men/">post</a> about our student-nominated speakers being all male, I think it's just on us to be vigilant and to put in the effort to reverse the natural trends that will otherwise keep re-appearing over and over.

tl'dr - let's work to live in a world with more of these creative and meaningful superlatives, for the women especially but also just for everyone:

<blockquote>
  Most interested in student career development
  
  Most likely to earn Leslie Knope #bossbitch status for being inspirational
  
  Most likely to hand you a periodic table of elements
</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Grappling with culture</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I really struggle to form a response to <a href="http://www.nationalreview.com/article/448894/democrats-georgia-special-election-why-democrats-keep-losing">this article</a>, and to this line of criticism in general. I heartily recommend my liberal (privileged, sheltered, safe, and well-fed) friends to read this and grapple with it at least a little.

<blockquote>... the limits of the resistance, a partisan phenomenon with no crossover appeal. Republicans don’t share the media’s obsession with the Russia investigation and don’t particularly care whether or not Michael Flynn should have been more careful about disclosing his lobbying work.</blockquote>

&nbsp;

<blockquote>Stopping Trump is imperative, so long as it doesn’t require the party rethinking its uncompromising stance on abortion, guns or immigration.</blockquote>

For me, I'm struggling to respond to the framing of - and therefore immediate dismissal or condemnation of - deep liberal issues as merely "cultural".

<!--more-->

Before I get into my grapples with that, as I was writing my response I realized and was taken aback by how quickly I accepted the author's use of "cultural" as a synonym for "fanciful". This is a rhetoric that I see come up again and again in National Review and Breitbart articles, and I didn't realize how little friction I have against that line of thinking now. Pretty worrisome, to be honest. I believe that culture is what makes us deeply and beautifully human, so using it as an adjective to diminish the importance of a thing is in itself a fascinating tactic. And the fact that it's working so easily on me is not something I am happy about! Ack! Maybe I've been reading too many National Review and Breitbart articles after all...

But back to the grapples.

On the one hand, the issues that this author dismisses as "cultural" are actually matters of life and death to many liberals. The central issue in the abortion debate isn't really whether a fetus is alive or not, it's whether women have the autonomy to control their own bodies and lives, or whether a roomful of men get to decide our fates. Gun control isn't about restricting access to recreation or stripping you of the ability to protect your family, it's about being able to walk in the streets or go to school and be relatively sure that you won't get shot. Immigration isn't about trying to dismantle American culture and communities and forcing us all to change, it's about giving every human a chance to fulfill their own potential, and about welcoming others with open arms and hearts. So obviously our stances on these issues are not merely "cultural" (in the dismissive sense of the word that the author intended) - they're about autonomy, dignity, and the right for humans to live our lives to their full potential. When conservatives rail against any of these issues, it's really hard to not see them as direct attacks on my and others' humanity.

On the other hand, the opposition is just as deep (and, from our point of view, can seem just as baselessly "cultural"). The issue of abortion is, quite literally, an issue of life or death (according to much conservative rhetoric, but obviously being pro-birth isn't the same as being pro-life). It's deeply about morality, and about protecting the most helpless among us - we liberals think that's one group of people, but some conservatives think it's the unborn, helpless babies. Different names for the same thing, in a way. Gun rights are about protecting yourself and your loved ones from harm - and being able to do it yourself. Immigration is about the security of having a job, of still having relevance and a purpose in your own community. Through these lens, the opposition to our own "cultural" issues, arguments which we also often see as rooted in irrational identity politics, is really just about autonomy, dignity, and the ability for everyone to live their lives to their full potential. If you told me that a whole party of people (liberals, that's us) was against all that - obviously I wouldn't vote for them no matter what!

<blockquote>
  "It’s not just that national Democrats don’t believe any give on these issues is necessary — they positively oppose it."
</blockquote>

So this is where the grappling really hits home. Obviously I think the liberal outcomes on these issues are the right ones - I want women to have the choice to control their own fates, I want kids to go to school and be safe from gun violence, I want immigrants to have the chance to fulfill their lives how they want to. But I also want conservatives to be less justified in writing articles like these. Yes, I want them to understand that what they think are mere "cultural" fancies for us are life and death matters. <em>And also</em> I want liberals to understand that what <em>we</em> think are mere "cultural" fancies for them are similarly viewed as life and death on the other side! There's a reason that the words "identity politics" trigger immediate conservative backlash and that this author characterizes the Democratic platform as an "orthodoxy on race, guns and immigration." How much of that reason is us?

And I want us to get creative in finding ways to move forward.

I don't believe that we should ever "give" on these issues in the sense that we shouldn't give them up, but I do think that we need a reframing. A more compassionate and creative conversation about how to make laws and party platforms that respect the needs and values of as many people as they can. After all, these are matters of life, death, and dignity for us all.

Of course, I don't know how we could even begin to have these creative conversations. I don't know how we could change our rhetoric so that the values behind the messages stay the same, but it's framed in such a way that conservatives no longer immediately plug their ears and yell "blah blah identity politics blah blah". Similarly, I don't know how the conservative rhetoric could ever move from articles that make my heart tie itself into a knot toward ones that I could engage in without feeling like I needed to check my own humanity at the door.

This is where I get stuck. I think to get there, we all need to take a step back from our convictions and engage deeply, curiously, and above all empathetically. But I don't see how that's possible when part of the conversation centers around what feels like (to us) a categorical rejection of our underlying autonomy, dignity, and potential. I could never engage in polite debate of the pros and cons of abortion to a roomful of men who have never had a pregnancy scare, or felt helpless in a roomful of older men just because of their gender, or seen a picture of their lawmakers signing a deeply hurtful bill and wanting to cry because they were all men. (Obviously that's the lens through which I'm interpreting this response, and certainly not the most threatening. I will never know what it's like to justify my right to be alive to a cop that pulled me over for a broken tail light, to argue for my existence when I can't even find a safe place to pee - let alone how to approach those conversations without being overwhelmed by a lifetime of trauma and survival mechanisms.)

I don't know how to reconcile the fact that <a href="https://medium.com/athena-talks/that-heineken-ad-isnt-sweet-it-s-dangerous-f743ba72d989">both sides are not the same</a> with my deep conviction that we absolutely must move beyond simply opposing conservatives "fiercely and vociferously" if we want to progress faster than the simple rate of generational turnover in society.

Update: I posted this article on my <a href="https://www.facebook.com/claire.duvallet/posts/10156205816128538?pnref=story">Facebook page</a> and actually got quite a bit of interesting conversation. My friend sent me to <a href="http://time.com/4805659/donald-trump-pittsburgh-paris/">this article</a>, which does a really good job providing one example of the kind of reframing I'm talking about. Again, it's not about changing our platform or giving on any of our ideals. It's about changing the conversation, so that there begins even a hope of reaching the other side.]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[I saw this article today, <a href="https://blog.conceptnet.io/2017/07/13/how-to-make-a-racist-ai-without-really-trying/">"How to make a racist AI without really trying"</a>, and love so many things about it! My favorite quotes:

<blockquote>
  Making a non-racist classifier is only a little bit harder than making a racist classifier. The fixed version can even be more accurate at evaluations. But to get there, you have to know about the problem, and you have to be willing to not just use the first thing that works.
  
  Some people expect that fighting algorithmic racism is going to come with some sort of trade-off. There's no trade-off here. You can have data that's better and less racist. You can have data that's better because it's less racist. There was never anything "accurate" about the overt racism that word2vec and GloVe learned.
</blockquote>

To me, the tl;dr of these (and all other "we improved our diversity-related problem!") articles is: it really isn't that hard to be better, <em>if you care</em>. That last part though, that's what'll get you.

<!--more-->

An example of an organization who didn't care, and royally fucked up: <a href="http://where.coraline.codes/blog/my-year-at-github/">GitHub</a>. And of course the <a href="https://www.susanjfowler.com/blog/2017/2/19/reflecting-on-one-very-strange-year-at-uber">Uber story</a> that everyone better have read by now.

An example of an organization who did care, and who put their money where their mouth is and saw <em>gasp! magical</em> improvements: <a href="https://hbr.org/2017/07/what-we-learned-from-improving-diversity-rates-at-pinterest">Pinterest</a>.

As I'm entering my third year working on diversity initiatives in my department, I'm finding myself stopped up against this wall so many times. It's not <em>that</em> hard to rethink how you do admissions or messaging or faculty recruitment, if you only care enough.  It's honestly not that hard to organize a conference with predominantly non-white male speakers - <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/02/21/microbial-centennial-of-men/">I promise</a>! If you care, then you'll try harder and be more thoughtful - and that's usually a really good first step to get you moving! It's not that hard to ensure that your <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/04/18/professor-superlatives/">professor's acknowledgements</a> are not completely gendered - if you care, then you'll try harder and be more thoughtful!

In my brief exposure to diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives in higher education, I've been baffled at how little critical thinking seems to be happening from people at the top. <a href="http://fisk-vanderbilt-bridge.org/">Certain groups</a> are definitely thinking critically about how to improve things, but generally speaking diversity and equity are not things that faculty care about and so they're not something that they think about with the problem-solving parts of their brains. Which is a shame, because that's literally supposed to be the strongest parts of their brains.

I really do believe that if faculty actually cared about diversity and equity the way they care about their research, the racial and gender disparities in STEM higher education could be improved so quickly. The problem is that that would require caring enough to put in the energy to learn about the systemic problems and brainstorm solutions, and then caring enough to actually implement and evaluate those solutions. Basically what you'd do for your research project, except for your community. More importantly though, and a much larger obstacle in my view, is that improving diversity in STEM higher education would require caring enough about the problem to recognize your own contributions and biases and then change yourself to be better. And I don't think faculty care about many things enough to respond by recognizing their failures and changing their behavior.

Finally, another fun quote that stood out to me in the racist AI article:

<blockquote>
  In retrospect, expecting news to be safe from algorithmic bias was rather a lot to hope for.
</blockquote>

This reminds me of the current news about the white woman who got shot by a black police officer, and how the public response and media coverage of her situation is so different than that of the recent police murder of Charleena Lyles. I can't find the most pertinent comparison that I saw earlier, but it was essentially a screenshot of a Fox news headline saying "Rest in peace Justine" juxtaposed with a "No results for Charleena Fox" screen on Twitter.

For more reading on this, I encourage you to google Charleena and Justine's stories, and pay attention to the language and sources covering them. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/kira.jackson.5030/posts/1385875234823102">This public facebook post</a> is a good place to start learning what to pay attention to, but there are so many others!

  <title>Quotas work</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In conversations about improving diversity in STEM, I tend to run into "well-meaning" faculty who are resolutely against quotas for fear that they will only exacerbate impostor syndrome and other negative perceptions (e.g. "you only got in because you're black"). This is such a frustrating position and although I haven't quite found a time, place, or way to push back against it yet, in my deepest heart of hearts I know it's fundamentally foolish.

First of all: why is it that in issues of diversity, we suddenly become incapable of being quantitative scientists? How are you going to know whether your programs are working if you don't set targets and have ways to measure your progress? How else can accountability truly happen?

Second of all: why is it that we go immediately from "we don't want people to think they didn't get here on their own merit" to "therefore we shouldn't have quotas"? Why can't we be more creative about the situation - if the true problem is that we don't want minority hires to feel unsupported or disrespected, why don't we actually address <em>that</em> problem instead? Where is the creativity? You could make the admissions/hiring process more transparent (like perhaps with explicit criteria and <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/article-abstract/2594729">"suitable substitutes or allowable similarities"</a>), you could publicly acknowledge and value all of the contributions the new hire is making to your department, you could foster a community that acknowledges and deeply values all the lived experiences and perspectives of their different members, and surely so many other things that would benefit not only the new hires but also everyone else.

Third of all: wait but seriously why not? <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/69193/1/Besley_Gender%20quotas_2017.pdf">It works</a>.

<!--more-->

From this article, deliciously titled <a href="http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/69193/1/Besley_Gender%20quotas_2017.pdf">"Gender quotas and the crisis of the mediocre man"</a>:

<blockquote>
  We ask how competence was affected by a "zipper" quota, requiring local parties to alternate males and females on the ballot, implemented by the Social Democratic party in 1993. Far from being at odds with meritocracy, this quota raised the competence of male politicians where it raised female representation the most. We argue that resignations of mediocre male leaders was a key driver of this effect.
</blockquote>

<blockquote>We show that competence increased following the introduction of the quota, and more so in municipalities where the quota led to the biggest increase in the proportion of elected women. Contrary to the expectations of quota sceptics, women's competence did not to go down but stayed roughly constant. However, the competence of the men went up significantly.</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  "We have shown that a larger bite of the Social Democratic gender quota raised the competence of elected candidates. This higher competence is due to the selection of male politicians, with no significant change of female competence. A careful look at the time patterns among leaders and followers reveals that the competence of male party leaders went up in the first election under the quota, while the competence of elected male followers went up in the next few elections. Upon closer inspection, the immediate improvement in leadership competence reflects a lower than usual survival rate among mediocre leaders."
</blockquote>

Very nice. Not sure how large the effect sizes really are (and the figures are really freaking hard to interpret) but I love this idea and data and framing. It's no secret that increasing diversity means that some of the people in power have to <a href="https://medium.com/@chanda/how-to-make-a-real-commitment-to-diversity-30ddb2cc4cc3#.shwrwdef1">"let go of their unearned power"</a>. It's nice to see it tested in a real-world scenario, and show that everybody ends up winning (except the people who used to be winning without really deserving it).

Some side notes purely about the paper:

They use income as a proxy for competence. That is, politicians who (before and after they were politicians) make more money relative to other people with similar demographics are considered competent. Very much dislike the money --&gt; value direct link. Not cool but hey, I guess it's a good enough proxy given, you know, capitalism.

Omg social science researchers need to get better at communication. This paper should have had three figures and been no more than 6 pages. It has 6 figures, 5 tables, and is 32 pages long. wowowow. What a slog!]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[&nbsp;

Man, clinicians are really on a roll with their curmudgeon, take-me-back-to-before-computers <a href="http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMe1516564">editorials</a>...

The JAMA viewpoint <a href="http://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2645762">"Unintended Consequences of Machine Learning in Medicine"</a> and its <a href="https://crossinvalidation.com/2017/08/15/are-physicians-worried-about-computers-machine-learning-their-jobs/">associated response</a> on the Cross Invalidation blog are really important reads. Both leave me fairly unsatisfied, however, in how little effort they make to acknowledge the validity of the other's viewpoints.

<!--more-->

The JAMA article is impressively negative and static. Probably every paragraph in the piece could be re-written to present the possible consequence of machine learning decision support systems (as it currently does), recommend research paths forward to mitigate those possible consequences, and present ongoing work in the field that is either directly attempting to address these consequences or could be adapted for medicine-specific applications. It also fails to discuss the "support" part of "machine learning decision support systems" - I don't think anyone anywhere is saying that machine learning should replace doctors, but many people do think that computers could help support doctors in being better at their (very difficult) jobs.

The response blog post does a slightly better job of recognizing what's going on on the other side of the aisle, but is also fairly static and defensive. If I were already a machine learning skeptic (because my thoughts on ML are driven mostly by my fear and/or lack of understanding of this complicated-sounding thing that seems to be taking over the world), nothing in this response would convince me to open my mind to any alternative viewpoint, mostly because nothing in this response makes the cause of my skepticism (fear, helplessness) feel heard.

For example, the rebuttal of the "uncertainty in medicine" part is really unempathetic. The JAMA author <em>does</em> have an important point that training labels in medicine are often very squishy (because even doctors disagree on what correct diagnoses are, and many times a diagnosis can't even really be pinpointed [see: all seasons of House]). But rather than recognizing the validity of the concern and reassuring readers that machine learning researchers are working on ways to deal with noisy training data, musing about how that could be applied to ML in medicine, and discussing the unique challenges we'll still have to figure out in medicine, the blog post just dismisses the concern outright. Not great for cross-field communication here...

Anyway, it's really frustrating to see clinician-focused journals continuing to put out non-forward-looking articles that will only serve to drive wedges between scientific researchers and clinicians. I'm glad the response to this article recognizes the need for these discussions, though I wish it approached the rebuttal more empathetically. Scientists need to do a better job of recognizing (and articulating their recognition) that humans and biology are messy affairs that will need a lot of hard work from many different types of players. Technology won't solve everything, and we need to stop sending the message to non-technologists that we think it will.

I've worked closely with a few clinicians during my PhD, and it's amazing what a completely different world medicine is than academic research. I wish we were all better at recognizing that miscommunications will happen because we literally speak different languages, that there is so much we don't know about the other side, and that at the end of the day, we're all actually on the same side.

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[My research is motivated by my interest in harnessing large, untargeted biological data to better understand, predict, and monitor human disease. More broadly, I'm interested in using <strong>personalized medicine approaches for public health</strong>.

My main project so far has been a large <strong><a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01973-8">meta-analysis of case-control gut microbiome datasets</a></strong> across multiple disease states. We found generalizable insights about patterns of disease-associated microbiome shifts: it turns out that you can characterize disease-associated microbiome shifts by their extent (how many bacteria are changed) and directionality (whether you have too many "bad" bacteria or not enough "good" bacteria). Also, we showed that most disease-associated bacteria in individual studies are not specific to one disease. This means that finding an association in one study really isn't enough to identify putative biomarkers or causal mechanisms, and we'll need to work harder to validate our findings with experiments and further meta-analyses.

I learned a lot about data collection and processing from this project, and have put the raw processed data on <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/840333#.WbdUMtOGPBI">Zenodo</a>. I also used this project as an opportunity to practice <strong>reproducible, open science</strong>, and I'm proud that every analysis in the paper can be re-made with the code on my <a href="http://github.com/cduvallet/microbiomeHD">github</a>. I also wrote a blog post talking about my experience writing this paper on Nature Microbiology's <a href="https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/users/70264-claire-duvallet/posts/22494-beyond-dysbiosis-disease-specific-and-shared-microbiome-responses-to-disease">behind the paper</a> blog series.

I'm also starting to think about how to use <strong>untargeted serum metabolomics to diagnose disease</strong>. We're hoping to approach untargeted metabolomics with the same "quick, dirty, and good enough" spirit that next-generation sequencing bioinformaticians took to revolutionize genomics. (Shh... don't tell your analytical chemist friends!)

I also work on some other projects around the lab. I've done work on the <a href="http://underworlds.mit.edu/">Underworlds</a> project in our lab, <strong>mining sewage for useful public health information</strong>. Soon we'll be starting to look at antibiotics and antibiotic resistance genes in sewage to better understand how they spread in the environment and how humans affect that spread. I'm also analyzing a clinical collaborator's dataset of <strong>lung, stomach, and throat microbiomes</strong> of over 200 pediatric patients with various aerodigestive conditions.

Finally, I'm interested in <strong>tool development.</strong> I've contributed significantly to our in-house <a href="http://github.com/thomasgurry/amplicon_sequencing_pipeline">16S processing pipeline</a> (yo and check out those <a href="http://amplicon-sequencing-pipeline.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">docs</a> tho!), to the <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0176335">re-implementation of distribution-based OTU clustering</a>, and to a method to <a href="http://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2017/07/24/165910">correct for batch effects</a> across case-control microbiome studies.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Hopkins Report on the Status of Women Faculty at MIT</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Last week, I learned about the 1999 <a href="http://web.mit.edu/fnl/women/women.html">Hopkins Study on the Status of
Women Faculty in Science at MIT</a>. This was apparently a report that made huge waves at MIT, partially because the President himself acknowledged the magnitude and severity of the problem:

<blockquote>First, I have always believed that contemporary gender discrimination within universities is part reality and part perception. True, but I now understand that reality is by far the greater part of the balance.</blockquote>

<!--more-->

<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK44861/">Nancy Hopkins' personal account of her involvement</a> with writing the report is striking in so many ways. In some ways, it feels like she could have been talking about me and my women peers: showing male colleagues bold statements only to be cautioned, steeling yourself emotionally before showing others these thoughts, looking to women who have "made it" for support only to find that they're right there with you, the power of solidarity both to make change and also to keep you mentally healthy, the amazing similarity of women's experiences and how we can finish each other's stories, and so on. Some aspects, though, were different: I don't think any socially-conscious woman and/or minority student goes into science thinking that they won't experience any challenges these days. I also think that the recognitions that family life plays into these disparities and that the impacts of marginalization increase as women progress in their careers are much better accepted these days. That said, perhaps I am over-estimating how truly "status quo" these ideas are, since most people think about these things far less than I do...

Anyway, I highly recommend reading Hopkins' story, and probably the report as well. To be honest though, I don't have the heart to do so myself - I wouldn't be able to stop myself from thinking "how does this compare to now?" and "how has MIT continued this sort of work since then?" with pessimism.

In the follow up discussion at the bottom of the account, I was struck by two comments: the first about secrecy, and the other about "just doing it." Just last week I got into an argument with my friends about why, as an organization, it's important to transparently and publicly commit to improving with respect to diversity (rather than just working on it behind the scenes, and "letting the results speak for themselves"). I think an important part of the results is the act of publicly valuing them, transparently, loudly, and proudly. I didn't succeed in convincing them that having clear and public policies with respect to diversity is important, and maybe the argument isn't evidence-based but rather just that I think it's the right thing to do. The discussion didn't give me any particularly new arguments here, but it was nice to see the lack of transparency called out explicitly:

<blockquote>
  The bottom line is that transparency is what is missing. What we don't see and what the departments need to do is to explain what the rules are. There is no secret, especially in a state university. That was one of the things I found out with my lawsuit: if there are no written rules, the guys can make them up as they go along.
</blockquote>

The other part of the discussion that made me smile was the part about asking for permission rather than forgiveness. This is one of my favorite things that I've learned from my advisor, actually - he's very good at this! I also found myself flexing my "<a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/02/04/women-in-data-science-conference-2016/">Just do what a man with your qualifications and abilities would do</a>" muscles twice this week. First, I received an email calling for "machine learning experts" to volunteer at a <a href="http://www.datakind.org/">DataKind</a> event. I do not consider myself a machine learning expert by any means, but I think many men with my technical qualifications might. So I answered the call, and had a really great time at the event (where I was fully, totally, completely qualified to be there). That said, even in my email response I had to check myself to not start my email with <em>"while I don't have much formal machine learning experience..."</em> And yesterday, I applied for an award that I am technically not qualified for (since my paper is not published yet) but for which I think I would be a great candidate. It was exhilarating to send my application in, and I can't wait to see what their response is. Hopefully positive! :P

<blockquote>
  So I think part of it is, we shouldn't ask so much. We should just do it.
</blockquote>]]></content:encoded>

    <wp:comment_content><![CDATA[I've been thinking about transparency recently. I think an important part of transparency is that it means public accountability. If the institution names a behavior or aims for a goal, it makes itself accountable if the behavior continues or the goal is not met.

re: going for it. I heard about the Dunning-Kruger effect at the IgNobels. Basically, incompetent people overestimate their competence, and concordantly underestimate other people's relative competence. Conversely, highly competent people underestimate the difficulty of tasks (because they find the work easy), and thus overestimate other people's relative competence. It's hard for them to understand that other people have a hard time doing a good job. It's interesting to think about this schema or quadrants or whatever with respect to men's/women's attitudes about their own competence.]]></wp:comment_content>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[JAMA just published a series of responses to the "<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2645762">Unintended Consequences of Machine Learning in Medicine</a>" editorial that had me <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/08/30/robots-arent-taking-doctors-jobs-and-its-okay-to-be-worried-they-might/">pretty disappointed</a> a few weeks ago.

My rapid-fire thoughts on each of the (very short!) articles:

<!--more-->

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2666494"><strong>Berner (EdD) and Ozaydin (PhD)</strong></a>

<blockquote>
  Although the cautions raised in the Viewpoint by Cabitza and colleagues should not be ignored, they also should not be used to inhibit the development of potentially innovative systems that can improve clinical care.
</blockquote>

<em>Yes, and</em> approach to ML and healthcare, not <em>no, but</em>! Hurray!

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2666496"><strong>Licitra (MD) et al</strong></a>

<blockquote>
  ... the unintended consequences can be viewed as opportunities to drive methodological changes in ML-DSS to improve health care.
  
  We agree with Dr Cabitza and colleagues that much needs to be done before ML-DSS can be safely used; however, we do not consider the methodological difficulties as reasons to shy away from the theoretical challenges created by this technology.
</blockquote>

Yes, use your knowledge and foresight to improve ML, not fight against it!
That said, this rebuttal focuses a lot on interpreting the black box that is machine learning algorithms, which I'm not totally convinced is the best place to put efforts. Interpretability is important, but I'd rather also focus on ensuring that we have equitable data and ways to identify bias, etc. If I trust that my algorithm is unbiased and/or accurate, I'm less worried about understanding the "why" (especially given that human decision-making is also a relatively uninterpretable black box...)

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2666495"><strong>Lasko (MD, PhD) et al</strong></a>

<blockquote>
  We argue that the negative consequences described by the authors are more often a product of misuse of machine learning, rather than anything intrinsic to its methods.
  
  To us, the salient message of this conversation is the need for highly trained medical data scientists who have a deep understanding of both clinical medicine and computational methods.
</blockquote>

Yes! We need clinicians and computationalists to work together and learn to speak each other's languages!

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2666492"><strong>Huesch (MBBD, PhD)</strong></a>

<blockquote>
  The authors’ conclusion raises the bar for artificial intelligence higher than that for new pharmaceuticals, medical devices, or changes in care delivery.
  
  It is also true that good artificial intelligence is often a black box, but so is the physician gestalt that drives much human decision making.
</blockquote>

Meh, I actually think it's pretty fair to hold AI to a higher standard than humans, especially where AI only provides marginal benefit to the human equivalent. Questions of responsibility are more easily answered when humans are making decisions, so to me that makes the burden of proof justifiably lower for humans than machines.

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2666493"><strong>Fogel (MBA) and Kvedar (MD)</strong></a>

<blockquote>
  The unintended consequence of artificial intelligence in medicine may mean that physicians will be able to focus on the tasks that are uniquely human: building trust-based relationships and applying reason and judgment to complex problems to help individual patients.
</blockquote>

Yes! Use machines to do the things machines are better at so humans can focus on doing the things humans are better at!

<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2666499"><strong>Cabitza (PhD) et al, original authors</strong></a>

<blockquote>
  Solutions to open the black box of ML-DSS can be considered technical, and we expect they will be refined in the future.1 More important are sociotechnical solutions, which must be endorsed and promoted at the management and policy level. These solutions are partly methodological, as pointed out by Licitra and colleagues, and partly related to training physicians better, as suggested by Berner and Ozaydin.
</blockquote>

To me this reads like "Yeah, they all bring up good forward-looking points but we were still right and we're still grumpy." tbh not sure what to make of this response, but I don't care that much because the rest of the conversation is really good! And in JAMA! Yay!

  <title>The microbiome meta-analysis is published, Part 1: personal reflections</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In all the excitement, I forgot to post about my microbiome meta-analysis getting published! You can read the paper at <a href="nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01973-8">Nature Communications</a> (for free because open science is the way it should be!) I also wrote a <a href="https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/users/70264-claire-duvallet/posts/22494-beyond-dysbiosis-disease-specific-and-shared-microbiome-responses-to-disease">blog post</a> for Nature Microbiology's Community Forum "Behind the paper" series.

Writing the "Behind the paper" post was really fun and helpful - it helped me think about how to communicate my motivation and findings to a broader audience, and was also really cathartic. For example, I got to mention some things that I believe to be true but which aren't supported by the data we currently have and so couldn't go in the paper. I also got to talk a little a bit about how hard it was to collect all the data - which feels really good because it can sometimes seem like collecting the data shouldn't be the hard part, you know? (Obviously any data scientist and computational biologist will tell you how hard it is... It just doesn't feel like a <em>glamorous</em> problem to have, unlike some hard scientific or statistical question or something.) And I got to step up on a small little soapbox and give a bit of editorialized perspective on doing reproducible science.

That said, there were still some things that were too personal or off-topic to include in the "official" blog post, which is what this <em>personal</em> blog is for! This post is mostly me being giddy and sharing my personal reactions to seeing this project come to fruition. I'll write <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/12/24/the-microbiome-meta-analysis-is-published-part-2-data-and-reproducible-science/">another post</a> with some more thoughts on what I learned about data and doing reproducible science.

<!--more-->

<h2>Personal reactions</h2>

The first thing that isn't fully reflected in the blog post is how proud I am of this work. To be honest, I didn't expect to ever publish in a journal like Nature Communications at any point in my PhD. But even with silly impact factors aside, I really feel like I contributed to the findings of this paper and that feels really good. The interpretation of the mostly-red vs. mostly-blue heatmaps is something <em>I</em> brought to Eric, and which he was super excited about. When I began this work, it seemed like a low-hanging fruit that anyone with enough persistence could do, but which didn't really require that much "intelligence". I'm a very stubborn person, so there's no doubt that I was capable of slogging through the data collection and processing. But there's always that <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/impostor-syndrome/">doubt</a> about the intelligence part... Not with this paper though. In no part of this do I feel like an imposter - neither with respect to the paper itself ("it's not important enough to be in a journal like Nature Communications") or with my contribution to it ("I'm a phony anyone could have done this"). No - this work is important, it represents a huge undertaking, I contributed meaningfully to the scientific takeaways, and it would have been a different (and likely less good) paper if I hadn't been involved.

On a related note, I actually got my first dose of #validation when I finally got around to reading <a href="http://nutrigen.ph.ucla.edu/files/view/epi-m258-spring-2012/Glass.pdf">the paper</a> that coined the term meta-analysis:

<blockquote>The best minds are needed to integrate the staggering number of individual studies... the integration of research findings is a scholarly undertaking requiring costly literature searches, extensive data analyses, and time to reflect and write.</blockquote>

Yes! This kind of work is hard and takes skill and should be respected! Let that be a lesson to us all that we should read foundational statistical papers more often, especially when our work is based on them! :P

The other fun and unexpected thing has been watching the responses to the paper on Twitter. It's been retweeted and liked a lot - Rafalab friends even suggested I calculate my <a href="https://genomebiology.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13059-014-0424-0">Kardashian index</a>  (it's 3.7). Twitter fame! Jokes aside, it's been refreshing to see that people are actually excited about this work. To be honest, I think a lot of the excitement isn't as much about the specific findings as it is a relief that finally someone did it (and that it didn't have to be them!) It was also really nice to see the people who retweeted our finding that lots of bacteria respond non-specifically to disease in solidarity. Like "finally, someone showed this thing that is obviously true but people keep ignoring and instead publishing over-hyped papers. Amen."

It was also really exciting to be <a href="https://twitter.com/chngin_the_wrld/status/938441000061505536">highlighted</a> as a Woman in STEM Doing Cool Stuff by an <a href="https://gph.ucsd.edu/people/core/Pages/strathdee.aspx">Important Woman</a> who I have never met! I put the tweet in my <a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/the-awesomest-7-year-postdoc-or-how-i-learned-to-stop-worrying-and-love-the-tenure-track-faculty-life/">happy folder</a>, and will be revisiting it anytime I need a reminder that there exist supportive and uplifting communities on the internet and in STEM!

And a group in Canada read my paper for a journal club and posted a <a href="http://dalmug.org/Meta-analysis-of-human-gut-microbiome-case-control-studies/">really great analysis</a> of it with some questions that we were able to <a href="https://twitter.com/BetaScience/status/942877788985528322">answer</a> (the internet is great). I've reached journal club status! Wow!!

Okay, that's enough giddyness for now. Read <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/12/24/the-microbiome-meta-analysis-is-published-part-2-data-and-reproducible-science/">Part 2</a> for some more technical reflections...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[<em>Read <a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/12/24/the-microbiome-meta-analysis-is-published-part-1-personal-reflections/">Part 1</a> for an introduction to this posts and some personal reflections on publishing the <a href="http://nature.com/articles/s41467-017-01973-8">meta-analysis paper</a>.</em>

The other thing I didn't focus on as much in the Nature Microbiology <a href="https://naturemicrobiologycommunity.nature.com/users/70264-claire-duvallet/posts/22494-beyond-dysbiosis-disease-specific-and-shared-microbiome-responses-to-disease">blog post</a> was all of the lessons I learned about data and doing reproducible science.

It turns out that doing reproducible science is really hard. Making data usefully accessible is not trivial, figuring out how to use someone's else data can be super confusing, and keeping track of what you've done gets unmanageable super quickly.

<!--more-->

Given how hot microbiome research is, when I started this project I thought it'd be super straightforward to gather data from like 100 studies, if not more. After two years of work, I published a paper with data from 28. It turns out that even inclusion criteria as broad as "case-control gut 16S studies" excludes a LOT of studies! Some other common difficulties I encountered, many of which resulted in excluding datasets from my analysis:

<ul>
    <li>Data is not uploaded anywhere, so you have to email the authors.</li>
    <li>Data is uploaded in a database, but it's protected because it contains senstive clinical metadata. This is a problem, because for analyses like mine you'd want to have a way to access the part of the data that isn't protected (e.g. sequencing data and case or control labels, but none of the other more detailed metadata). That said, whether or not microbiome data should be protected is still being <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/112/22/E2930.full">debated</a>.</li>
    <li>Data is publicly available, but the metadata is not. A note to all experimentalists: raw data without its metadata is almost always useless.</li>
    <li>Data and metadata are publicly available, but the IDs don't map between them.</li>
    <li>Data and metadata are available, but barcodes mapping raw data to samples is not available.</li>
    <li>Data and metadata are available and mappable, but they don't match what was reported in the paper.</li>
    <li>Everything is available, but I can't tell what processing steps have been done already. This is actually usually okay - you can just look at the raw data and check, for example, whether primers or barcodes have been removed. However, there was one case where all of the reads were 101 bp but the primers hadn't been removed, and I had no idea why on earth that would be the case.</li>
</ul>

In addition to feeling like a data detective, there were a few times when I felt like a time traveller:

<ul>
    <li>I encountered a handful of hotmail.com and aol.com email addresses in my communications with authors, which always makes me chuckle!</li>
    <li>It was also interesting that the majority of my datasets were 454 data, whereas the field is now essentially only doing Illumina sequencing. But I think because of how slow academia is, the majority of papers that were out there when I started were from a previous era! It's like the engineers who keep up with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/03/magazine/the-loyal-engineers-steering-nasas-voyager-probes-across-the-universe.html">Voyager satellite</a> and still know how to code directly in binary. Okay, it's not like that at all but still!</li>
    <li>Along those lines, there were a few data formats I encountered that would be ridiculous to have now but which are understandable for studies that were right at the beginning of the NGS boom. For example, quite a few datasets had a subset of their samples in each raw fastq file, but repeated barcodes across files. This meant that the same barcode was in multiple fastq files, but mapped to different samples. Annoying to process, but no biggie.</li>
    <li>And there was also travelling into the future, when I went to look for data that hadn't been uploaded yet.</li>
</ul>

I give these examples not to gripe about how everyone sucks at data, but to show that making data usefully available for others to use isn't as straightforward as it sounds! Through my own mistakes in the course of this work, I gained a lot of sympathy (and sometimes empathy) for all the moving parts involved in doing reproducible science.

I made so many mistakes throughout the data processing and analysis. Because I started this project basically as soon as I joined Eric's lab (i.e. before I knew anything about doing computational work), I had to go back and re-do a lot of my data processing - sometimes because I had done it wrong, but most often because I hadn't documented what I did and I couldn't be sure that I hadn't messed it up. In life, I like to try act such that future Claire will think of past Claire and be eternally grateful for her. In life, that means putting a glass of water on my nightstand before going to sleep after a raucous night out. In computational biology, I learned that that means leaving a robust bread crumb trail of READMEs and comments with every data collected and analysis performed.

I also had so many mini-panic attacks where I thought that I had done something completely wrong (like use the wrong statistical test) that would affect all of my other downstream results. If I were a more legit programmer, I would have figured out how to include <a href="https://github.com/ericmjl/data-testing-tutorial">unit tests</a> throughout my code - though I honestly wonder when this extra effort is worth the benefit, especially in iterative data analyses. <a href="https://github.com/cduvallet/microbiomeHD">Instead</a>, I wrote a Makefile to do all of my analyses so that when I had these doubts it only took an hour or two to resolve them rather than a whole day. You too can perform a broad cross-disease meta-analysis of 28 published case-control gut microbiome studies using standardized methods!

All this to say that I learned to love READMEs and clean code. And some science along the way too, I guess. :)]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Reflections on Amazon same-day delivery excluding Roxbury</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[One of the keynotes discussing disparities in big data at this year's <a href="http://psb.stanford.edu">Pacific Symposium on Biocomputing</a> pointed to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2016-amazon-same-day/">Bloomberg article</a> about Amazon's same-day delivery areas: in Boston (at the time of writing), all neighborhoods surrounding Roxbury were eligible for same-day delivery but Roxbury was not.

<img class="  wp-image-1448 aligncenter" src="https://claireduvallet.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-06-at-10-38-11-pm.png" alt="Screen Shot 2018-01-06 at 10.38.11 PM" width="350" height="327" />

I <a href="https://twitter.com/cduvallet/status/949452472942174208">tweeted</a> that when I saw this, my jaw literally dropped (which it did) - not because I'm surprised that this was the case, but because I was so surprised to see such a clear irrefutable example of bias in algorithms. Like, there is no Occam's razor explanation you can give for the map above, not if you're being serious with yourself.

<!--more-->

A couple things stuck out to me in the Bloomberg article. First:

<blockquote>There’s no evidence that Amazon makes decisions on where to deliver based on race. Berman [Amazon’s vice president for global communications] says the ethnic composition of neighborhoods isn’t part of the data Amazon examines when drawing up its maps. ... Amazon, he says, has a “radical sensitivity” to any suggestion that neighborhoods are being singled out by race. “Demographics play no role in it. Zero.”</blockquote>

Here's the thing. If race isn't part of your data, then you can't control for it and your decisions will end up being based on it. It's irresponsible to say "we didn't explicitly use race in our algorithms therefore race is not affecting our results" when we know that race affects every aspect of American society. I'd argue that arguing otherwise demonstrates a "radical <strong>insensitivity</strong>" to the role that race plays in America.

Another completely unsatisfying cop-out:

<blockquote>Amazon says it’s misleading to scrutinize its current delivery areas so closely, because the service is new and evolving. Eventually, coverage will extend to every ZIP code in same-day cities, says Berman. The service is indeed expanding. Since Bloomberg first contacted Amazon for this article in February, the company announced 12 new same-day cities. As it adds locations, however, Amazon has yet to extend coverage to excluded majority-black ZIP codes in the existing cities with gaps in service. How long will those customers have to wait to get the full benefits of their Prime membership? Berman says there’s no set timetable: “We’ll get there.”</blockquote>

No, by now you've made it clear that you won't get there on your own.

It's also <em>so obvious</em> that whatever excuses Amazon is giving about what's preventing them from expanding their business equitably are just bullshit: since the Bloomberg article was published in April, Amazon has expanded coverage to the previously excluded predominantly black neighborhoods in Boston, New York City, and Chicago. It's so clearly a question of desire and will and not one of logistics.

I love this article because it identified a problem, demonstrated it with data (and beautiful visualizations), and resulted in action. More of this, less of bullshit excuses.

So to rapidly expanding businesses who are shaping our culture: you have a responsibility to do better. Recognize that ignoring something (like race) doesn't make it go away and that just because something isn't in your data doesn't mean it's not in your data. Care more, act thoughtfully, and do better for everyone.]]></content:encoded>

  <title>Caring about diversity is not that hard (part 2)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[Every time I re-read my post "<a href="https://claireduvallet.wordpress.com/2017/07/21/caring-about-racism-is-not-that-hard/">Caring about racism is not that hard</a>", I've been torn about whether or not I'm being too hard on the faculty who I've worked with for the past few years. On the one hand, I know that they do care deeply about these issues. On the other hand, I've been mostly disappointed at the relative lack of self-starting, inertia-overcoming, proactive-game-changing energy and responses I've received. In the post, when I say "if only faculty cared," what I really mean is "if only faculty cared enough to make theses issues as high of a priority as research." I really don't want to imply that they <em>don't</em> care, I just want to point out that they don't seem to care <em>enough</em>.

<!--more-->

I recently read something that explained my frustrations and dismay really concisely. Some context: a group of women ultimate frisbee players are organizing a boycott of the AUDL, which is currently the only pro league in our sport and also all-male (technically it's an "open" league which means that women can try out and play, but functionally it's only men). The AUDL responded, but the organizers were not satisfied and wrote this <a href="http://skydmagazine.com/2018/01/audl-boycott-open-letter-steve-gordon-commissioner-audl/">open letter</a> in response. This part stuck out to me:

<blockquote>
  Our broad impression is that the AUDL perceives many barriers to change, but that most of these perceptions are based on untested or flawed assumptions. We have also gotten the impression that AUDL leadership has not been motivated to think with enough creativity or urgency about how to overcome those barriers.
</blockquote>

This is exactly how I feel when I discuss the need to radically re-think the way we approach diversity initiatives in my department and in STEM in general. Urgency and creativity from our people in power is what we need, not giving up and saying "it's too hard" when what they really mean is "that would be uncomfortable/it's too much work to be worth it to me." And it's doubly-disappointing because testing assumptions and approaching problems creatively are things that academics are supposed to excel at. For some reason, though, not in this case...]]></content:encoded>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this post, I'm going to go through some tricks I've learned to plot pretty boxplots in Python.

<div id="notebook" class="border-box-sizing">
<div id="notebook-container" class="container">
<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered">
<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">

Boxplots are my absolute favorite way to look at data, but the defaults in Python aren't publication-level pretty. When making boxplots, I think it's very important to also plot the underlying raw data points whenever that's possible. Especially for main text figures and/or in cases without that many points, this is the best way to simultaneously summarize the data and allow the reader to come to their interpretations of it. When I read a paper, I get fairly grumpy when I know that the sample size is low (say, less than 100) but I only get to see the boxplot. Just let me see the data - otherwise, I have to wonder if you're trying to hide something...

Anyway. In this post, we'll be using <code>seaborn</code> to establish the main boxplots, with some additional tweaking to make them beautiful. Of course, I didn't come up with these solutions all on my own, and deep gratitude goes to Stack Overflow for teaching me these tricks (in addition to almost everything else I know about coding).

</div>

<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered">
<div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">

First, let's set up some toy data. Here, we'll be simulating making some measurements on three different body sites for 15 healthy patients and 10 diseased patients.

<h1 id="Default-boxplot-with-seaborn">Default boxplot with seaborn</h1>
The default seaborn plot isn't bad, but it also isn't great. I typically use a call to <code>boxplot</code> first and then <code>stripplot</code> to show the raw data. Note that doing this makes the legend wonky - I usually fix this afterwards (or, more often than not, deal with the legend separately).

The easiest way to improve these plots is to (1) change the seaborn style to <code>'white'</code> and (2) pass in a color palette that you like. Also note that when you plot both a boxplot and the raw points, you should tell seaborn not to plot any of the outliers with <code>fliersize=0</code>, otherwise you'll have double-points for these.

If we want, we can also play with the facecolors. We can also do this with a normal call through the <code>palette</code> keyword in the seaborn function:

That looks pretty good (and is the version I ended up going with for my current manuscript), but what if you also want to change the line colors to match the hues? In this case, you need to go directly edit the artists after they're drawn.

So far, I've been removing the legend because of the annoying double-legend issue when you call both <code>sns.boxplot</code> and <code>sns.stripplot</code>. I haven't found a great way to get around this except the very manual way of going in afterwards and keeping only the first half of the legend:

Also a note that you can change the width of the boxplot with the <code>width</code> parameter in the call to <code>sns.boxplot</code>. However, this doesn't change the width of each individual box, but rather the total width of each pair of boxes (or however many hues you have). So in the case where the data spans a similar range and the boxes are right next to each other (like in site 1, above), sometimes the box lines overlap slightly. If they're not black, then you can see this if you look closely. I haven't figured out a good wayt o fix this (and <a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/1076">it seems like</a> maybe there might not be one).

And, finally, in this post I didn't go through and pretty up the axes labels but that's also something you need to do to make a figure publication-worthy. Add some capital letters, replace underscores with spaces, and make all font sizes quite large.

  <title>Making beautiful boxplots in Python (note: code is gross bc no indents! Fix this first!)</title>

  <content:encoded><![CDATA[In this post, I'm going to go through some tricks I've learned to plot pretty boxplots in Python.

<h1>Boxplots</h1>

Boxplots are my absolute favorite way to look at data, but the defaults in Python aren't publication-level pretty. When making boxplots, I think it's very important to also plot the underlying raw data points whenever that's possible. Especially for main text figures and/or in cases without that many points, this is the best way to simultaneously summarize the data and allow the reader to come to their interpretations of it. When I read a paper, I get fairly grumpy when I know that the sample size is low (say, less than 100) but I only get to see the boxplot. Just let me see the data - otherwise, I have to wonder if you're trying to hide something...

<!--more-->

Anyway. In this post, we'll be using <code>seaborn</code> to establish the main boxplots, with some additional tweaking to make them beautiful. Of course, I didn't come up with these solutions all on my own, and deep gratitude goes to Stack Overflow for teaching me these tricks (in addition to almost everything else I know about coding).

<h1>Generate data</h1>

First, let's set up some toy data. Here, we'll be simulating making some measurements on three different body sites for 15 healthy patients and 10 diseased patients.

 

[code lang=python]
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Set up the data
data = np.concatenate(
[[np.random.normal(loc=1, size=15), 15*[&#039;site1&#039;], 15*[&#039;healthy&#039;]],
[np.random.normal(loc=3, size=15), 15*[&#039;site2&#039;], 15*[&#039;healthy&#039;]],
[np.random.normal(loc=0, size=15), 15*[&#039;site3&#039;], 15*[&#039;healthy&#039;]],
[np.random.normal(loc=1, size=10), 10*[&#039;site1&#039;], 10*[&#039;disease&#039;]],
[np.random.normal(loc=1, size=10), 10*[&#039;site2&#039;], 10*[&#039;disease&#039;]],
[np.random.normal(loc=3, size=10), 10*[&#039;site3&#039;], 10*[&#039;disease&#039;]]],
axis=1)
df = pd.DataFrame(columns=[&#039;value&#039;, &#039;site&#039;, &#039;label&#039;], data=data.T)
df[&#039;value&#039;] = df[&#039;value&#039;].astype(float)

# Show every ninth row
df.iloc[::9]
[/code]

<h1>Default boxplot with seaborn</h1>

The default seaborn plot isn't bad, but it also isn't great. I typically use a call to <code>boxplot</code> first and then <code>stripplot</code> to show the raw data. Note that doing this makes the legend wonky - I usually fix this afterwards (or, more often than not, deal with the legend separately).

[code lang=python]
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
%matplotlib inline

sns.boxplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df)
sns.stripplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df,
jitter=True, split=True, linewidth=0.5)
plt.legend(loc=&#039;upper left&#039;)
[/code]

The easiest way to improve these plots is to (1) change the seaborn style to <code>'white'</code> and (2) pass in a color palette that you like. Also note that when you plot both a boxplot and the raw points, you should tell seaborn not to plot any of the outliers with <code>fliersize=0</code>, otherwise you'll have double-points for these.

[code lang=python]
sns.set_style(&#039;white&#039;)

pal = sns.color_palette(&#039;Paired&#039;)

sns.boxplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df,
palette=pal, fliersize=0)
sns.stripplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df,
jitter=True, split=True, linewidth=0.5, palette=pal)
plt.legend(loc=&#039;upper left&#039;)
[/code]

Alternatively, you can explicitly specify the colors you want for each hue value.

 

[code lang=python]
pal = {&#039;healthy&#039;: &#039;green&#039;, &#039;disease&#039;: &#039;blue&#039;}

sns.boxplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df,
palette=pal, fliersize=0)
sns.stripplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df,
jitter=True, split=True, linewidth=0.5, palette=pal)
plt.legend(loc=&#039;upper left&#039;)
[/code]

<h1>More modifications</h1>

While convenient, this is also not beautiful enough to be publication-worthy. If we want to make really nice boxplots, we'll have to roll up our sleeves and get more into the details.

 

[code lang=python]
# When you start digging into the parameters, it&#039;s a good idea
# to explicitly initialize the figure and get the figure and
# axes handles
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

# First, we&#039;ll pick some nicer colors for the healthy and disease.
# I got these colors by tweaking some colors from the Set1 palette
# in powerpoint, and then grabbing the hex code from Powerpoint.
dark_brown = &#039;#B25116&#039;
dark_pink = &#039;#FB84D1&#039;
pal = {&#039;healthy&#039;: dark_brown, &#039;disease&#039;: dark_pink}

# Here, we set up some properties for the boxplot parts. I definitely
# stole this from Stack Overflow, but I can&#039;t find the original post
# right now.
boxprops = {&#039;edgecolor&#039;: &#039;k&#039;, &#039;linewidth&#039;: 2, &#039;facecolor&#039;: &#039;w&#039;}
lineprops = {&#039;color&#039;: &#039;k&#039;, &#039;linewidth&#039;: 2}

# Set up some general kwargs that we&#039;ll use in both the stripplot and boxplot
# Note that you can change the order of hue variables here.
kwargs = {&#039;palette&#039;: pal, &#039;hue_order&#039;: [&#039;disease&#039;, &#039;healthy&#039;]}

# The boxplot kwargs get passed to matplotlib&#039;s boxplot function.
# Note how we can re-use our lineprops dict to make sure all the lines
# match. You could also edit each line type (e.g. whiskers, caps, etc)
# separately.
boxplot_kwargs = dict({&#039;boxprops&#039;: boxprops, &#039;medianprops&#039;: lineprops,
&#039;whiskerprops&#039;: lineprops, &#039;capprops&#039;: lineprops,
&#039;width&#039;: 0.75},
**kwargs)
stripplot_kwargs = dict({&#039;linewidth&#039;: 0.6, &#039;size&#039;: 6, &#039;alpha&#039;: 0.7},
**kwargs)

# And we can plot just like last time
sns.boxplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
fliersize=0, **boxplot_kwargs)
sns.stripplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
split=True, jitter=0.2, **stripplot_kwargs)

[/code]

If we want, we can also play with the facecolors. We can also do this with a normal call through the <code>palette</code> keyword in the seaborn function:

 

[code lang=python]
pal = {&#039;healthy&#039;: dark_brown, &#039;disease&#039;: dark_pink}

# Set up another palette for the boxplots, with slightly lighter shades
light_pink = &#039;#FFC9EC&#039;
light_brown = &#039;#E5B699&#039;
face_pal = {&#039;healthy&#039;: light_brown, &#039;disease&#039;: light_pink}

hue_order = [&#039;disease&#039;, &#039;healthy&#039;]

# Make sure to remove the &#039;facecolor&#039;: &#039;w&#039; property here, otherwise
# the palette gets overrided
boxprops = {&#039;edgecolor&#039;: &#039;k&#039;, &#039;linewidth&#039;: 2}
lineprops = {&#039;color&#039;: &#039;k&#039;, &#039;linewidth&#039;: 2}

boxplot_kwargs = {&#039;boxprops&#039;: boxprops, &#039;medianprops&#039;: lineprops,
&#039;whiskerprops&#039;: lineprops, &#039;capprops&#039;: lineprops,
&#039;width&#039;: 0.75, &#039;palette&#039;: face_pal,
&#039;hue_order&#039;: hue_order}

stripplot_kwargs = {&#039;linewidth&#039;: 0.6, &#039;size&#039;: 6, &#039;alpha&#039;: 0.7,
&#039;palette&#039;: pal, &#039;hue_order&#039;: hue_order}

# And we can plot just like last time
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.boxplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
fliersize=0, **boxplot_kwargs)
sns.stripplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
split=True, jitter=0.2, **stripplot_kwargs)
ax.legend_.remove()
[/code]

That looks pretty good (and is the version I ended up going with for my current manuscript), but what if you also want to change the line colors to match the hues? In this case, you need to go directly edit the artists after they're drawn.

 

[code lang=python]
# Plot, using all the same parameters as above
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.boxplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
fliersize=0, **boxplot_kwargs)
sns.stripplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
split=True, jitter=0.2, **stripplot_kwargs)
ax.legend_.remove()

for i, artist in enumerate(ax.artists):
if i % 2 == 0:
col = dark_pink
else:
col = dark_brown

# This sets the color for the main box
artist.set_edgecolor(col)
# Each box has 6 associated Line2D objects (to make the whiskers, fliers, etc.)
# Loop over them here, and use the same colour as above
for j in range(i*6,i*6+6):
line = ax.lines[j]
line.set_color(col)
line.set_mfc(col)
line.set_mec(col)
[/code]

<h1>A few final notes...</h1>

So far, I've been removing the legend because of the annoying double-legend issue when you call both <code>sns.boxplot</code> and <code>sns.stripplot</code>. I haven't found a great way to get around this except the very manual way of going in afterwards and keeping only the first half of the legend:

 

[code lang=python]
# Plot, using all the same parameters as above
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
sns.boxplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
fliersize=0, **boxplot_kwargs)
sns.stripplot(x=&#039;site&#039;, y=&#039;value&#039;, hue=&#039;label&#039;, data=df, ax=ax,
split=True, jitter=0.2, **stripplot_kwargs)

# Fix the legend, keep only the first two legend elements
handles, labels = ax.get_legend_handles_labels()
lgd = ax.legend(handles[0:2], labels[0:2],
loc=&#039;upper left&#039;,
fontsize=&#039;large&#039;,
handletextpad=0.5)
lgd.legendHandles[0]._sizes = [40]
lgd.legendHandles[1]._sizes = [40]
[/code]

 

<img src="2018-01-20.boxplots_files/2018-01-20.boxplots_16_0.png" alt="png" />

 

Also a note that you can change the width of the boxplot with the <code>width</code> parameter in the call to <code>sns.boxplot</code>. However, this doesn't change the width of each individual box, but rather the total width of each pair of boxes (or however many hues you have). So in the case where the data spans a similar range and the boxes are right next to each other (like in site 1, above), sometimes the box lines overlap slightly. If they're not black, then you can see this if you look closely. I haven't figured out a good wayt o fix this (and <a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/issues/1076">it seems like</a> maybe there might not be one).

And, finally, in this post I didn't go through and pretty up the axes labels but that's also something you need to do to make a figure publication-worthy. Add some capital letters, replace underscores with spaces, and make all font sizes quite large.
