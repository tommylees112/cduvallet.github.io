# Committee meeting slide titles that make me feel things

## "I am a rising 4th year" (Slide 2)

Because let's be real my advisor can barely keep track let alone my committee! But they better keep it in mind - I'm gettin' old! lulz 

## "In order to graduate, I should have demonstratedâ€¦"

Empty slide. Gulp. I have my own bullet points in the next slide, but I want to hear what my committee says first. This is terrifying.
