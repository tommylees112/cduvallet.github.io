I just ran across this [report](http://www.liftstream.com/women_biotech_boardrooms.html#report) about gender diversity in biotech boardrooms (spoiler: it's not great).

> An optimistic output of the study is that almost 58% of the studied boards now have women serving on them.

There is nothing optimistic in that statistic - a little less than half of boards have**Â no women at all**. Progress won't be made so long as we keep framing reality in bullshit ways like this.

> ...diverse boards (having at least one seat held by a woman)...

I'm sorry, what? One (probably white) woman on the board is enough to be considered "diverse"?
