I came across this great [blog post](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/08/24/replication-crisis/) again today while doing some literature search for one of my projects. I remember really enjoying this post when I first encountered it, and it was as much of a joy to read the second time around! What I appreciate about this article is that it doesn't try to refute the contentious [claim](http://journals.plos.org/plosmedicine/article?id=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124) that "most [biomedical] research findings are false" but instead puts a _"yes and..._" spin on it.

Many biomedical research findings are "false", _and also_ that's to be expected. We're in a field without much basic theory to back us up, dealing with noisy and complex systems (oh hi humans) and noisy and complex measurements.

> The replication crisis in science is largely attributable to a mismatch in our expectations of how often findings should replicate and how difficult it is to actually discover true findings in certain fields... Ultimately, when someone asks, “Why _haven’t_ we cured cancer yet?” the answer is “Because it’s hard”.

I also like this article because it reminds me of my own [rants](https://www.nature.com/nrd/journal/v2/n2/pdf/nrd1012.pdf) about bioengineering research - I personally struggle to find inspiration and meaning in results based on cell lines or animal models (give me the real thing, like poop!) _and also_ I recognize the tremendous [value](https://progressreport.cancer.gov/trends) that these kinds of studies provide.

I would, however, add one bullet point to the end of the blog post's list:

  * We should invest in science dedicated to understanding and developing the basic theory underpinning biological sciences.

I mean, we humans figured out thermodynamics -- you can't tell me biology is harder than that and we're just gonna give up!!
