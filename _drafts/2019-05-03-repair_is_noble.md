# Fixing my tech

I recently came to be the proud owner of an [iFixit Pro Tech Toolkit](https://www.ifixit.com/Store/Tools/Pro-Tech-Toolkit/IF145-307). I had initially begun fixing my iPhone because I kept having problems with the screens and I have now fixed a number of phones for friends.

Today I had the pleasure of replacing the battery in my 13" 2012 Macbook Air. I had the [part]() ordered from iFixit and had a wonderful time following their [online guide](https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/MacBook+Air+13-Inch+Mid+2012+Battery+Replacement/10950?gclid=Cj0KCQjw2IrmBRCJARIsAJZDdxANA48MDEz8nH_UmlvXABy_vfcf0RzZq7DnSTsDLH6XP9dSLpMOb_MaAsFUEALw_wcB). Yes it was more expensive than some other replacement batteries but I have ordered stuff from them before and more than that I really appreciate their guides and want to support the work they do and the free repair guides they publish.

# Responsible companies

I am definitely skeptical of ['corporate greenwashing'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenwashing), but having recently read Yvon Chouinard's wonderful book, [Let my People go Surfing](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22155.Let_My_People_Go_Surfing) I am convinced that business offers a huge opportunity to do socially and environmentally responsible work, and set an example to inspire others.

If you have a brief glance at the [iFixit website](https://ifixit.org/) you get a sense of their mission.

> Repair saves you money. It saves the environment. And it connects us to our things. Ditch the throwaway economy. Join the repair revolution.

The environmental costs of technological waste are huge. Polluting water supplies

> FIX IT YOURSELF.
>The world needs fixing. Some people don’t have clean water because they don’t know how to repair their water pumps. Many companies don’t make parts and manuals available to independent repair experts. We’re fixing that.
> iFixit is the free repair manual. Fix your things. We’ll teach you how.

This is the thing that really gets me. I absolutely love feeling useful. It's great to tinker with my laptop or my phone, I own it and I should have the [right](https://ifixit.org/right) to open it up and play with it. I have actually started checking their [laptop](https://www.ifixit.com/laptop-repairability) and [smartphone](https://www.ifixit.com/smartphone-repairability) repairability scores before I consider buying any new kit.

Not only do they offer equipment, parts and guides, they also have become famous for their 'tear downs' which are great fun to [watch](https://www.ifixit.com/Teardown/iPhone+6s+Teardown/48170). These are videos of the iFixit team taking tech apart and let you see the guts of the machines we use everyday. It's crazy to say but it is **liberating** to take apart your own kit and see the pieces for yourself. that go into the phone in your pocket.

I definitely reccommend fixing your tech. It's gives you a sense of ownership for the tech we have and encourages us to stop throwing away these resource intensive pieces of kit. On top of that, it's incredibly fun if nothing else!
