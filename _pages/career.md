##Â **My goal is to solve societally relevant problems using data and computational statistics**

My ideal **role** is as a Data Scientist or Data Science type person. I want to:
- be meaningfully involved in data analysis.
- apply modelling techniques to derive insights from data.
- engage others to get them excited about these insights.

My ideal **company**:

- Works with lots of different datasets addressing a variety of problems.
- Has a strong focus on **lifelong learning** and continous improvement.
- Has a focus on **delivering impact** and improving people's lives.
- Is filled with **people who are constantly striving to be better**.

## **Jobs I would love to do:**

- Working for an organisation that uses data to improve responses to and forecasting of **natural disasters**.
- Working for a company looking at using **Earth Observation data for mapping and monitoring** of social deprivation, water and food security and the spread of disease.
- Working with a Data Science consultancy firm who are approached with interesting datasets and problems and are tasked with **finding actionable insights from those datasets**.
- Work on political polling or sports analytics.

After viewing the play Hamilton, I left thinking _'Hamilton had the American Revolution. What is my American Revolution?'_. I believe the most pressing issue of our times is **climate change**. It is a global issue that interacts with all other issues, whether they are **inequality** or **lack of access to education, sanitation and other human rights**.
