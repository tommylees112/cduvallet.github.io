> _I am a recovering athlete with a coding problem and an obsession with learning stuff._

I'm a PhD student with the [NERC Environmental Research DTP](https://www.environmental-research.ox.ac.uk/) at Oxford University.
I work with [Professor Simon Dadson](https://www.geog.ox.ac.uk/staff/sdadson.html) and [Dr Steven Reece](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~reece/) studying East African Droughts using Earth Observation data.
I'm extremely interested in applying **Machine Learning** techniques to Environmental Science to try and **combine Earth Observation and Model** data.

I'm passionate about **learning new techniques**, about **contributing to open source tools** and **bringing people together** to address the most pressing challenges facing our species.

When I'm not messing around at my computer I can often be found doing a number of sports. Like a recovering alcoholic, I never seem to be able to get away from competing. Formerly a member of the **GB Modern Pentathlon Team**, I now run with the University Athletics Teams, Swim with the University Swimming Teams and have Fenced with the University Fencing Team.

Coding is the *superpower* I am trying to develop. I love the ability to **build** software, and enjoy experimenting with **Data Science** techniques and love finding **data to answer interseting questions**.

This site is my way of **sharing** some of this work with the world...

## **Skills that I am actively developing**

- Programming
- Data Science
- Mathematical and Statistical Modelling
- Distilling complexity to deliver clarity (communicating research)

## Other Experiences
Before moving to Oxford I worked in Cambodia for a **Water and Sanitation** NGO, [WaterSHED](http://watershedasia.org/). As part of the Business and Development Team I was responsible for exploring ways of getting **stakeholders to share their data**. People were extremely receptive to the idea and we partnered with [Open Development Cambodia](https://opendevelopmentcambodia.net/) to provide a platform for organisations to pool their data resource. This work involved working closely with WaterAid, and the Government of Cambodia.

I have also spent time in London as a Web Analyst for a Digital Marketing Agency, and in Southampton with Ordnance Survey, the UK National mapping agency.
